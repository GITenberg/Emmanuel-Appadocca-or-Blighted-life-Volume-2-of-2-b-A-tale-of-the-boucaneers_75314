<p>The small cutter that was carrying Agnes and the
other captives held her course towards the land.</p>

<p>It could not but occur to the priest and to his ward,
unaccustomed as they were to encounter dangers, that
their position was one which was in itself highly, if not
imminently perilous. There they were, thrown in an
open vessel on the ocean, and sent on a voyage which
was to consist of three days’ or more beating up against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the wind and the waves, while their little vessel was
every moment subjected to the accidents of a very tedious
and difficult navigation.</p>

<p>These thoughts were the more forcibly thrust upon
the priest, when after the lapse of a day, and on the
approach of night, it was to be perceived that no progress
towards the land had been made. The little
cutter had tossed about on the high billows, had tacked
and re-tacked, still at the close of the day she was not
much nearer the end of her voyage than when she was
thrown off by the schooner. Under the influence of
these thoughts, the priest lost much of his cheerful
equanimity. He looked concerned, and his conversation
did not flow so freely as it was wont to do. Perhaps
this was a happy accident for Agnes; for that young
lady, apparently disinclined to speak or to listen, still
leaned over the side of the cutter, and, from time to
time, cast a side-long look at the schooner that was
sailing away in another direction.</p>

<p>The first night of the voyage came, and augmented
still more the alarm of the priest. He felt his isolation
among the other men whose pursuits and habits were
different from his, and now freely allowed his mind to
conjure up fears of assassination and robbery. To add
to his suspicions, the sailors of the captured ship seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
to herd closely together, and to sympathise but little
with their fellow passengers. The master fisherman,
true to his promise, paid the greatest attention both to
the sailing of his little vessel, and to the safety and
comparative comfort of those who had been placed
under his especial care.</p>

<p>When the sun, that true and never disordered timekeeper
of the tropics, had on the next morning illumined
the ocean, the first thought and first action of Agnes,
was to cast her eyes around and survey the horizon.
Nothing was to be seen; the Black Schooner had disappeared.
Scarcely believing her eyes, she looked and
looked again; it was as the eyes made it out, and not
as the wish would have it; there was no vessel to be
seen. Dejected, wretched, sad, and disappointed, she
suspended her further survey, and began again to contemplate
the blue waters that was rushing pass the
jumping cutter. A sad feeling was that of Agnes, the
feeling which arises when we lose the last memento of
some dear and cherished creature: the memento which,
in the absence of the object that it recalls to our memory,
receives, perhaps, the same amount of worship as the
being itself which it represents. Whatever be the
nature of such a token, it is all the same: a golden toy,
a lock of hair, a favourite pin, a prayer-book, these are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
amply sufficient to strike up within us the active
feelings of grief-clothed happiness, and to awake anew
the recollections of periods whose real and unbroken
felicity never permitted us to contemplate or fear a
change. To lose one of these imaging toys, is the breaking
away of the last link that binds us, in one way at
least, to the objects which they symbolize. On such
sad occasions the heart is stricken with a prophetic fear,
which like the canker-worm ever afterwards eats deeply,
and more deeply into our spirits, until there is nothing
more to eat away.</p>

<p>Agnes felt this when she could no longer see the
Black Schooner. As long as she could gaze on the
vessel, there was still a little consolation, or, perhaps
her grief was still subdued, but when that vessel disappeared
from her view, it reached its height and preyed
upon her without mitigation. Who has not stood on the
sea-washed strand and watched the careering ship that was
bearing away father, lover, or child, and felt his tears
restrained as long as a waving handkerchief could convey
the ardour of a last “farewell,” but who, a few
moments after, experienced the bitter misery that
followed, when the ship had disappeared from the view,
when an unsympathising horizon had veiled in silence
and in obscurity his lost and lonely friends, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
damp spirits were left free to recoil upon themselves?
What person is there, who in the hey-day of existence,
at the age when the heart is fresh, and the spirits are
high, when necessity intervened to drive him away
from among friends and relatives, has not felt the pang
of separation more and more as every familiar object
was, one by one, left behind, and gradually disappeared
from his view.</p>

<p>“Agnes, you are sad,” said the priest, who notwithstanding
his own anxiety, and disquiet of mind, could
not but mark the unsettled and unhappy state of his
ward.</p>

<p>“Not very, sir,” the young lady replied, “though our
present condition is not the most pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Truly not,” answered the priest, “still we must
hope that we shall soon arrive on land. Recollect, that,
although we are not now very comfortable, we are still
on a voyage towards home, and that thought ought to
support us under greater inconveniences than the
present.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Agnes, “we are returning home, and
that is a comfort.... How beautiful this water is,”
she continued, falling naturally into that romantic train
which was necessarily called forth by the present state
of her sentiments, “how remarkably beautiful are those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
blue waters, and how pure and transparent is that thin
foam which now fringes yon crystal wave!”</p>

<p>“All the works of the Creator are beautiful, my
child,” answered the priest.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Agnes, “and the ocean is so still
and quiet: who could ever imagine that it contained so
many terrible monsters.”</p>

<p>“True;” remarked the priest, “surfaces, my child,
are, alas! too frequently deceptive. For instance, take
the appearance of the ocean this beautiful and blessed
morning; it looks as pure and unspotted as when the
sun first dawned upon it on the fourth day of creation;
still, how many murderous deeds have there not been
done upon it since that time, and over how many wrecks
of human fabrics has it not rolled? If we could penetrate
its depth, and see its bed, we should probably
behold the skeletons of the fierce Caraibs that first
inhabited this part of the world, and their rude instruments
of war, blended confusedly together with the
bones and elaborate weapons of their more polished
conquerors; while the large fishes that still hold possession
of their medium of existence, now peer with meaningless
eyes into the naked skulls, or rummage for their
food the rotting wrecks of the bristling war-vessels that
once rode these seas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Agnes felt thankful for this long and solemn observation,
which gave her time to think on one of the vessels
that had not as yet become a wreck beneath the ocean.</p>

<p>After a pause, the priest continued:</p>

<p>“This basin over which we are now sailing, my dear
Agnes, may have once been high and dry land, and the
islands which are scattered about in this horse-shoe
fashion, may have been—.”</p>

<p>“Stop, sare,” interrupted the master fisherman, who
the reader may recollect was constituted the captain
and proprietor of the cutter when it was dispatched from
the schooner, and who was now sitting between Agnes
and the priest, steering the boat, “stop, sare,” he said,
endeavouring to make himself understood in English,
“me wees hear something they say there,” and he made
an almost imperceptible sign towards the bows of the
cutter, where the sailors of the captured ship were sitting
together, and speaking among themselves in a sort of
half whisper. The master fisherman’s attention had
been attracted towards them by a few words which he
had overheard, and being suspicious lest they should
presume upon their numerical strength, and make an
attempt to take possession of the cutter, he was anxious
to make himself acquainted with their plans in order to
anticipate them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“We will never get ashore at this rate, Bill,” said
one sailor to another.</p>

<p>“I’ll be d—n—d, if we will,” answered the other,
“what the devil does that d—n—d jack Spaniole know
about steering a boat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so loud,” whispered another.</p>

<p>“He don’t understand English, and I don’t care if he
did,” answered the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it is a devilish hard case,” joined in
another, “that we should be obliged to sit here and let
that fellow, who don’t know a jib from a paddle-box,
steer the boat.”</p>

<p>“What do you say if we take the management, my
hearties?” inquired a lean, long-featured individual.</p>

<p>“Hum,” groaned one.</p>

<p>“Suppose we do?” inquired another.</p>

<p>They whispered still lower among themselves for a
moment.</p>

<p>“I say, you sir—you sir, keep her off, will you, don’t
you see the wind is right a-head?” shouted one to the
master fisherman, in a tone of derision.</p>

<p>“Keep her head up, Mr. Spaniole, d’ye hear? don’t
you see the wind is turning her round?” cried another.</p>

<p>These insults seemed lost on the master fisherman, for
he took them with marvellous fortitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“My good men,” said the priest, “forbear: consider
where we are, and under what circumstances we are
placed; pray, do no not endeavour to cause any
quarrel.”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business, parson, will you?” shouted
a bolder sailor than the others, “it is you who already
prevents us going any faster; so, if you don’t wish to
be sent to Davy Jones, hold your tongue.”</p>

<p>The priest became now quite alarmed:</p>

<p>“Do not answer them,” he whispered to the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Hollo! there; ready about,” continued one of the
sailors, apparently bent on provoking a quarrel, “ready
about,” and he proceeded to let go the jib-sheet.</p>

<p>The master fisherman now quickly stood up, with the
marks of anger already becoming visible in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Stop, or me kill you,” he cried, while he levelled one
of the pistols, with which he was armed, at the audacious
sailor.</p>

<p>“Kill him, will you,” simultaneously shouted two of
the sailors, and rushed together towards the stern of the
cutter, “kill him, will you, you cut-throat Spaniard?”</p>

<p>The master fisherman stood firm where he was. He
now held both of the pistols, which Appadocca had
given him, and raising them to a small distance before
him, awaited the two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Undeterred by the weapons, they rushed on.</p>

<p>“Stop for your life!” cried the master fisherman,
highly excited.</p>

<p>“Be reasonable men,” cried the priest, as he also
stood up to defend himself.</p>

<p>The men came on;—flash,—a report—and the bullet
pierced the foremost one. He fell into the bottom of
the cutter, and rolled over the master fisherman’s other
man, who had been wrapped in sleep in that part from
the very moment that he had got into the cutter.</p>

<p>“Hon!” he groaned and awoke, as the sailor that was
shot rolled heavily upon him, when, seeing the blood,
he jumped up.</p>

<p>The shrieks of Agnes, the fierce and deep Spanish
oaths of the master fisherman at once told him how
matters stood. He grasped the first of the sailors that
came within his reach, and wrestled with him. Both
fell into the bottom of the cutter, and rolled about on
the ballast.</p>

<p>The quarrel had now assumed a serious aspect; furious
at the death of their comrade, the other sailors
rushed to the stern of the cutter. The master fisherman
discharged the other pistol: it told, another sailor fell.
But the shot was no sooner fired, than one of the two
other sailors, closed with the master fisherman. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
wrestled: each pressed successively his adversary on
the side of the cutter, endeavouring to throw him overboard;
but they were well matched: their strength was
equal: now, the master fisherman was down, and seemed
to be about to be thrown overboard; now he had the
sailor down in the same position. Both fought with
desperation, and clung with the pertinacity of iron to
the side of the vessel. The cutter, having no one to
steer it, had flown into the wind, its sails were flapping,
and its boom was swinging violently, from one side to
the other. The master fisherman was now down; over,
over, the sailor was gradually pressing him; his grasp
began to relax: he was bending farther towards the
water; the sailor raised himself a little, so that he might
have a better purchase to strike the final blow: as he did
so, the boom swung violently, and struck him on the
temple, with a great splash, he fell a yard or two into
the water. The master fisherman quickly rose, and
went to the assistance of the priest, who had met the
attack of the remaining sailor, and was now holding
him down in the bottom of the cutter. The master
fisherman clutched a stone, and in his passion, was going
to dash out the brains of the prostrate sailor.</p>

<p>“Hold!” cried the priest, “no more violence: bring
a rope, and let us tie him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The master fisherman drew back his arm, and let fall
the stone. Even in his fury he felt the force of his
natural veneration. He brought a rope, and tied the
sailor down.</p>

<p>“Do the same to the other,” said the priest, now
almost exhausted by his effort, “tie him too.”</p>

<p>The remaining sailor, who was still languidly rolling
at the bottom of the cutter, with the fisherman, was
next pinioned.</p>

<p>“See now to the wounded,” said the priest, who now,
when his first terror was over, displayed great presence
of mind.</p>

<p>The two men who had been shot were examined.
They still breathed, although their wounds were very
serious.</p>

<p>The attention of the priest was now turned towards
Agnes, who sat almost petrified with fear in the place
where she was.</p>

<p>“Thank God, this danger is also past,” said the
priest to her, “I must be guilty of some grievous sin,
indeed,” continued the good father, “to have thus
drawn down upon us the chastisement of Providence.
Twice have we passed through bloodshed and death,
and who knows what new perils we may still have to
encounter before we reach Trinidad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Yes: and when shall we reach it? It looks as if we
were never to get back,” and Agnes was overwhelmed
by a multiplicity of different feelings.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said the priest, “I think it would be
easier to proceed straight towards it, than to be beating
about on these seas.”</p>

<p>“Have you any object to go to Granada in preference
to any other place?” he inquired of the master fisherman,
who had now adjusted the sails of the cutter, and
resumed the tiller.</p>

<p>“No, he had not,” was the reply: “he was endeavouring
to make that island because it was the nearest land
indicated to him by the pirate captain.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be easier to sail at once to Trinidad?”
again asked the priest.</p>

<p>“Most decidedly,” was the answer; “the distance
was greater, it was true,” added the master fisherman,
but that was overbalanced by the fairness of the wind,
because they would then be able to sail with a free sheet
and should gain Trinidad within an infinitely shorter
space of time than it would take to make Granada, by
beating up against the wind from the position in which
they then were.</p>

<p>“Then let us steer to Trinidad,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the master fisherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The cutter was kept off, the sheets and tacks were
slackened, and the little vessel, now feeling the full force
of the wind began to tear through the water.</p>

<p>Away, away, it went. During day and during night
the master fisherman sat gravely at the tiller; neither
fatigue nor want of sleep could induce him to entrust
for a moment the command of the little vessel to his
man; “He had taken an oath,” he said to the priest,
when he requested him to take some rest.</p>

<p>It was on a beautiful morning when the priest and
Agnes, on awaking from their uncomfortable slumbers,
beheld themselves within the Gulf of Paria.</p>

<p>They looked with highly-pleased astonishment at the
master fisherman, who wearied and worn, still sat at the
rudder. He returned the glance with the same visible
contentment and pleasure.</p>

<p>“We are indebted to you, my good fisherman, for
your incomparable conduct towards us. We shall
scarcely be ever able to show you sufficient gratitude,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Not at all: we must deal well towards those who
conduct themselves in a proper manner to us,” said the
fisherman, in the best manner he could; “now I am at
home again; I am on my own gulf,—where do you wish
to be landed, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“Land us wherever you please: we will be always
able to make our way to Cedros,” answered the priest.</p>

<p>“To Cedros? I shall take you there at once,” answered
the master fisherman, and then turned the
cutter’s head to that part of the island.</p>

<p>“Agnes,” whispered the priest, “I have always found
much that is to be admired in the humbler classes; they
require but proper treatment, as all other men do.”</p>

<p>“This seems to be a very worthy man,” replied Agnes,
more in respect to the priest than from any desire to
converse, for Agnes had ceased to be over communicative
since the capture of the vessel in which she had
been a passenger.</p>

<p>The sugar-cane fields arose more conspicuous and
beautiful to the view as the vessel drew nearer and
nearer to the land; and within a few hours Agnes
arrived on the plantation and was locked in the affectionate
embrace of her aged father.</p>

<p>The grey dawn of the morning found the crew of the
man-of-war busily at work. The unwieldly machines
clanked and reclanked as the sturdy sailors heartily
threw their whole strength upon them, in raising the
heavy sails and weighty anchor.</p>

<p>As soon as there was sufficient light to see, watches,
who were provided with the most powerful telescopes,
were sent up to the very top of the tall masts to survey
the horizon, in order to discover, if possible, the pirate
vessel, which was supposed to be hovering about at no
great distance.</p>

<p>After a careful survey, the report was made, that far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
out to leeward there was a sail—that it was apparently
a vessel which was lying to.</p>

<p>“Look again,” shouted out the officer of the watch,
“what is she like? is she square-rigged?”</p>

<p>“No, your honor.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a thing is she?”</p>

<p>“She looks to be a fore-and-aft, your honor.”</p>

<p>Willmington was called, and, on being required to do
so, gave the best description he could of the pirate
vessel.</p>

<p>“It is likely the same vessel,” the officer remarked,
after he had heard Willmington.</p>

<p>“Cheerily, men, look active.”</p>

<p>The sailors scarcely required any exhortation. They
went through their work with more than ordinary good-will.
In the first place, the idea of something like active
service excited them, for they felt oppressed under the
ennui of leisurely sailing from one port to another; and
they longed to chastise the rash temerity of those degraded
wretches who had the insolence to make an
attempt of rescuing a prisoner from their lordly ship.</p>

<p>The majestic structure, therefore, was soon put in
motion, and was now to be seen sailing magnificently
before the wind. Gradually it gained on what was at
first distant and obscure. As the ship drew nearer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
nearer to it, the vessel grew more and more distinct, and
could now be clearly made out as a long, low, rakish
schooner. It was, in fact, the Black Schooner.</p>

<p>The huge vessel-of-war approached nearer and still
nearer, but the schooner remained still stationary where
she was. The sailors of the man-of-war prepared for
action with enthusiasm. They could easily judge, from
the shape of the schooner, and its peculiar rig, that she
was the vessel of a pirate, if not of the pirate of whom
they had so often heard. They saw their prize before
them. The schooner, they thought, must yield to the
superior strength of the man-of-war, and her conquest
would be the easiest thing in the world. Besides, the
little vessel could not but perceive their approach, and
as she did not sail away, they argued there must needs
be some cause, either mutiny or some other disagreement
on board, which neutralized the authority of those
in power, and which, consequently, would make her a
still easier prize. They prepared their guns, on this
account, with the keenest alacrity and lightness of heart,
for men are always the more enthusiastic and brave
when they are pretty well assured that they can command
success.</p>

<p>The large vessel sailed down on the small schooner,
that was still lying to, the standard of England was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
already waving from the spanker, the men were standing
at their several stations, and the commander himself,
who had now come on deck, was anxiously waiting
until he came within gun-shot of the schooner, to signal
her to surrender. The ship drew still closer, the order
was given to make ready to fire, when ... like the
shadowy fleetness of a dream, the masts of the Black
Schooner at once became clothed in canvass, the black
ensign with the cross bones and skull ran up the line on
her gaff in chilling solemnity, while on the top of her
raking masts floated two long pendant flags as red as
blood, and the sharp vessel began to glide like a serpent
silently over the waters.</p>

<p>Fearful of losing his prize, which was well-nigh
within his reach, the commander of the ship-of-war
observing the movements of the little vessel, quickly
gave the order to fire. A loud and rending report of
several guns at once echoed over the waves, and the
shots dipped, and dipped, and dipped again, and fell
harmless within a short distance of the schooner. The
flag of the pirate schooner was lowered and hoisted,
lowered and hoisted, lowered and hoisted again, in
derision, as she steadily held her course. Another discharge
... and the shots sank as harmless as before:
again the pirates lowered and hoisted their flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Every sail was set on the unwieldly ship, and her
enormous studding-sails covered her yards and booms.
Her hull could scarcely be seen, under the vast sheets
that shaded her. The waves boiled up on each side of
her bows, and like a whale, furious with a wound, she
left behind her a wake of foam.</p>

<p>The Black Schooner glided along like a slender gar.
Confident of the fleetness of their vessel, the pirates
seemed inclined to mock the large and threatening fabric
that was pursuing them. Ever and anon they changed
their tack, and the vessel itself, which seemed to anticipate
their wishes, played gracefully on the blue surface.</p>

<p>When all the ship’s studding-sails were set, and she
was sailing rapidly before the wind, they would suddenly
change their course, and draw their obedient vessel as
close as possible up to the wind. As soon again as the
man-of-war went through the labour of taking in her
superfluous sails, again they would change their course.
Now they shortened their sails, and then, as the ship
gained on them, they had them up again as if by magic.
Now they sailed away to a great distance, and then
tacked and returned as if to meet and brave the pursuers;
all the time, however, they kept out of the
reach of the man-of-war’s guns with astonishing precision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The chase continued thus the whole day, until night
came and veiled pursuer and pursued.</p>

<p>Vexed with disappointment, and irritated by the
taunts of the pirates, the commander of the man-of-war
ordered the sails to be taken in, and the vessel to be
luffed up into the wind. The order was immediately
obeyed, and the crew, in thorough disgust, went away
from the station to which they had that morning
rushed with so much buoyancy.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, sufficient, to try the moral fortitude
of the most philosophical. On one side there was a
large heavy vessel, of size sufficiently huge to have
crushed two such vessels as the pirate-schooner,
from mere contact: on the other was that small and
light vessel, which could be so easily destroyed, but
which, notwithstanding the most eager desire on the
part of the commander and crew to capture her, had so
tantalizingly escaped them. After the continued chase
of a whole day, the large vessel had proved as
impotent and as incapable of carrying out their wishes,
as a piece of floating timber; and what was still
more galling, they had, in addition, been exposed to
the most annoying derision of the pirates. Worse
again, there was no probability of her being able, at
any time, to overtake the schooner; for it was too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
clear that their large vessel could not sail so fast as she.
The only chance of their capturing her was, in their
taking her by surprise, an event which could not be
reasonably calculated upon, when the pirates exhibited
so much prudence and precision. The sailors, therefore,
doggedly retired to their respective cots, muttering all
the while, strong and complicated oaths against the
individual who built the fast-sailing schooner.</p>

<p>As for the commander himself, he bore the disappointment
with the less dumb patience, as the discipline
of the ship did not bind him down to so much silence,
as it did the crew. He fumed only as seamen can
fume, and vowed, in the extremity of his anger, that
he would perpetrate, Heaven only knew, what extent
of cruelty,—which he never meant,—upon the insolent
pirates, if he once had them in his power.</p>

<p>When calmer moments, however, succeeded to his
wrathful feelings of disappointment, he began to think
deeply on the course which it was prudent to adopt, in
order to have a probable chance of capturing or destroying
the schooner. The batteries and the crew of the
ship, he rightly concluded, were of no use against an
enemy that was sufficiently wise and experienced always
to keep beyond the range of his guns; and, as for overtaking
the schooner, it was a matter of absolute impossibility.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
He could decide on no clear plan. He, therefore,
resolved, in that conjuncture, to sail about in those
parts under little canvass, and trust to accident for a
means of capturing the pirate vessel. The ship was,
therefore, kept under only a part of her sails that
whole night, and she moved almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>At the first dawn of the next morning, watches
were sent up the masts, and the horizon was carefully
surveyed in search of the enemy which night had
shrouded. Nothing was to be seen. The watch was,
nevertheless, continued.</p>

<p>About four hours after sunrise, a vessel could be
barely distinguished on the horizon. It was steering
in the direction of the man-of-war. It rapidly approached,
and as it drew nearer and nearer, it was discovered to
be a long, low, sharp-built brig, with white port-holes,
apparently a Mediterranean trader. She sailed so fast,
that within three hours from the time when she was first
discovered, she was opposite the large ship. She passed
her at a short distance, but beyond the range of her
guns.</p>

<p>The man-of-war immediately hoisted her ensign as a
signal to the brig to show her colours; in answer to this
signal, the strange vessel hoisted the Mexican flag.</p>

<p>The extraordinary speed of the strange brig, her low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
hull, the more than ordinary symmetry of her make and
rigging, could not pass unobserved. They at once
attracted the notice, and called forth the admiration of
the sailors on board of the man-of-war; and leaning
carelessly on the bulwarks, they were studying the
beautiful brig before them, and were viewing her with
the delight that seamen experience when they see a fine
vessel.</p>

<p>“If that ain’t that ere identical pirate customer as we
chased yesterday,” said an old grey-headed sailor, gravely,
as he stood looking at her, “it’s one of the same sort, I
know.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying, now,” asked a young man
next to him.</p>

<p>“Why, the vessel we chased yesterday was a fore-and-aft
schooner, and this one is a brig: where are your
eyes?”</p>

<p>“Is this all you know?” inquired the old tar, indifferently,
with a slight satirical smile. “Well, let me tell
you, younker, that them ere customers change their
skins, just like snakes, by G—d; and these eyes of mine
that you inquire of, winked at a sou-wester long before
you knowed what was what, my boy,” and the old
seaman walked away to attend to some passing occupation,
while, from time to time, he cast a stealthy look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
from under his spreading straw hat, at the vessel he
seemed to hold in suspicion.</p>

<p>This feeling towards the Mexican brig was not confined
to the common sailors alone: all seamen have an eye
for the beautiful in ships. The commander himself was
struck by the remarkably fine proportions of the vessel.
He interrupted his habitual walk to gaze at her.</p>

<p>“A fine craft that is, Charles,” said he to his son.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the latter, “a very beautiful
model.”</p>

<p>“Look at her run, what a beautiful stern, and how
sharp at the bows!” continued the old gentleman, with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“And how remarkably fast she sails, too,” rejoined
Charles.</p>

<p>“Hum!” remarked the old gentlemen, “she seems
very light to be a trader.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me so, too,” replied Charles.</p>

<p>“The merchant who could have built that vessel to
carry cocoa and coffee, must have been a very great
fool, Charles,” continued the commander, still looking
at the tidy brig that was sailing away magnificently
before him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I begin to have my suspicions, Charles,” resumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the commander, after a pause, “that Mexican flag protects
many a rascal: I shall make the fellow heave to.”</p>

<p>So saying, he ordered a gun to be fired, as a signal to
the brig to lie to. The report of the huge machine of
destruction rang over the waters, and the shot skipped
the waves and sank. The suspicious brig paid no
attention to it, but held her course, and, in four hours’
time, went out of sight, leaving the commander in now
stronger suspicion with regard to her nature and character,
and, in a furious rage into which he was thrown by
the cool contempt with which his command was treated.
He looked at the brig that was leaving his vessel behind,
as if the latter was at anchor, and fretted, when he considered
that his large ship was unable to enforce his
order on account of its comparative slowness. With
greater impatience than reason he looked only at
what was, for the moment, a defect in the large man-of-war,
and forgot, at the time, that if the two small
vessels which had so mortified him, those two consecutive
days, had over his ship the accident of speed,
she, in her turn, possessed the infinitely more serviceable
advantage of greater strength and more heavy
metal.</p>

<p>“Well, younker,” said the same old sailor of the
morning, to the same young man who had doubted his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
penetration, “well, younker, what do you think of that
ere customer now, eh? He has the wind in his maintopsail,
has’nt he? and seems to have plenty of pride
of his own, and won’t speak to nobody. Ay, ay, them
customers, never throw away words or shots, I know.
Come, younker, I’ll give you another wrinkle,” continued
the old tar.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have it?”</p>

<p>“Mark my word,” continued the old sailor, in a low
and mysterious tone, “if you don’t see that ere customer
again, before long, my name is not what it is, I
know,” and winking impressively on his hearers, he
rolled away chuckling with self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>The man-of-war continued there the remaining portion
of that day and the night which ensued: nothing
happened, during that period of time, to relieve the
longing anxiety of the man-of-war’s people.</p>

<p>The next morning the usual watches were again sent
up the masts. About noon, a vessel came in sight. It
was steering, like the one of the previous day, directly
towards the man-of-war; and seemed to approach her
with an equal degree of speed. As she drew nearer and
nearer, she was made out to be a light brigantine, such
as those that are to be seen on the Mediterranean.
Strange, however, the hull and make seemed to be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
same as those of the vessel spoken the day before: but
the new comer, instead of painted port-holes, had but a
plain white streak.</p>

<p>The men evinced the same admiration for this “craft,”
to use their own term, as they did for the one of the
day before. There was, however, such a striking
similarity in the hulls of the two vessels, that their
admiration soon gave place to a feeling of mixed surprise
and suspicion.</p>

<p>“What can those two crafts be?” they mutually
asked each other.</p>

<p>“They are men-of-war,” some answered: “but where
are the port-holes of this customer?”</p>

<p>“By jingo! I think they are pleasure boats,” said one.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they look to me like Malaga boats,” said
another.</p>

<p>“But they are of the same make,” observed a third.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, don’t you see they are sister-vessels, fools,
and are on the same voyage?” said another, gravely,
who, up to that time, had maintained unbroken silence,
and had, with the aid of a serious aspect, looked wisdom
itself.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s it, that’s it,” they all cried, at this suggestion,
“they belong to the same owner, and are on the
same voyage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>All seemed to concur in this opinion, except the same
old sailor, who, on the previous day, regarded the
Mexican brig with so much suspicion. He seemed to
entertain doubts about this new vessel, as he did with
regard to the other.</p>

<p>“Well, younker, what do you think of this fresh
gentleman, now?” he said, satirically, to the unfortunate
young man who had offended his self-esteem, and
who seemed now to be entirely devoted to the revengeful
ridicule of that elder son of Neptune.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” was the crabbed reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, eh? you will know, perhaps, when
them young eyes of yours have squinted oftner at the
sun, my hearty, hi, hi, hi!”</p>

<p>The brigantine drew nearer and nearer, and seemed
carefully to measure the same distance at which the brig
of the day before had passed. She came with her sails
filled with the fresh breeze, and was passing the man-of-war,
when one of the heavy guns of the large vessel was
fired. The shot fell across the brigantine’s bows, but at
some distance from her.</p>

<p>Her sails still bellied with the wind; she still skipped
along, and the beautiful and pure white wavelets of
foam still swelled on each of her sides.</p>

<p>“Who the devil you may be, I shall have you to-day,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
said the commander, looking intently fierce at the
brigantine. “Give him another shot.”</p>

<p>Another deafening report was heard, and the grey
smoke shrouded for a moment the dark riggings of the
war-vessel, and then grew thinner and thinner, and rose
above her masts.</p>

<p>A moment after, four flags ran up the peak of the
brigantine.</p>

<p>“Ho! read what the fellow says, Mr. Cypher,” cried
the commander, with no small degree of excitement,
“he hears what we can say, I see.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cypher took the telescope.</p>

<p>“Y,” he said, “O,” he continued, “U,”—“YOU,”
he proclaimed, with a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Hoist the answering pendant:” it was done.</p>

<p>The first four flags of the brigantine were now lowered,
and four others hoisted in their place.</p>

<p>“A,” proceeded Mr. Cypher, deciphering the new
signal, “R,” “E,”—“ARE,”—“you are.”</p>

<p>“Hoist the answering pendant:” it was done again.</p>

<p>The four flags were again lowered on board the
brigantine, and four new ones were again hoisted. They
were read, and were found to signify ‘too.’</p>

<p>“What can the fellow want to say?” inquired the
commander, vaguely: “answer his signal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The signal was answered, and other flags were again
hoisted on board the brigantine. When all the signals
were taken together, they read—</p>

<p>“You are too far, your guns don’t carry.”</p>

<p>While at the conclusion of the process of exchanging
signals, the broad black flag, with its head and bones,
was spread over the mainsail.</p>

<p>“The rascals,” muttered the old commander, as he
moved away from the bulwarks, with indignant disgust,
“it is the same set, may the devil take them!”</p>

<p>“Ha, younker, what d’you see now, eh? You will
believe old Jack Gangway another time, I know,” said
the same old sailor, who all along had been so knowing
and so suspicious.</p>

<p>“Crack on, crack on,” cried the old commander, “and
haul your wind, we may edge up to her on a close bowline,
and let her feel our metal.”</p>

<p>All the sails of the large vessel were now set. She
was drawn closely to the wind, and leaned under the
fresh breeze.</p>

<p>No sooner was this manœuvre completed, than the
brigantine’s sails were also trimmed, her long yards
were braced sharp; her vast mainsail was pulled in
almost on a line with her rudder, and her head was put
almost into the point of the wind itself, or, as seamen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
would designate it, into the “eye of the wind,” her
stern was turned to the ship-of-war, and as she gradually
left the latter behind, other four flags ran along the
signal line. When read they said—</p>

<p>“Au revoir.”</p>

<p>And the black flag rose and fell, rose and fell again,
at the mocking ceremony, that was intended to
accompany this salutation.</p>

<p>This chase continued the rest of the day. The hours
quickly fleeted by, and when gauzy twilight had shed its
soothing and dreamy haze around, a few waves of the
pirate’s flag, might still be dimly perceived, like the
trembling of the phantom—leaves of dream; and then
darkness spread its shrouding mantle over the ocean.</p>

<p class="tb">The sun had risen, the man-of-war was lying-to under
one or two sails, the others had been taken in during
the night; at some distance in the direction, in which
the brigantine had disappeared, a vessel, apparently a
wreck, was to be seen. She was a barque: portions of
her masts were broken away; her rigging was slack,
loose, and dry; her racketty yards waved from one
direction to the other, as she clumsily rolled into the
trough of the sea, or rose heavily on its crest. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
braces dangled loosely and neglectedly about, and either
dragged overboard, or swung with a spring from one
part of the deck to the other. In keeping with her
disordered gear, her hull itself exhibited the greatest
neglect and uncleanliness: the barnacles grew unmolested,
to a considerable height, and the marks of the
lee-water from the cuppers, stained her sides. The
few sails which still remained on the unsteady yards
were tattered and worn, and tied up in the oddest
manner imaginable. The vessel had her English ensign
tied upside down, in token of distress, on the little that
remained of the mainmast’s rigging: an indication,
which was not by any means required, in as much
as the miserable manner in which she rolled about, was
quite sufficient in itself, to tell that she was in a
wretched condition.</p>

<p>As soon as the distressed vessel was perceived, signals
were made to her to launch her boats, and to send alongside;
but they seemed to be either not understood, or
the people of the barque had no means of answering
them.</p>

<p>But one solitary individual was to be seen standing
on its deck, at the gangway, and wistfully looking
towards the man-of-war.</p>

<p>The commander was not willing to launch any of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
boats, he had, during the three or four days that had
lately expired been so much cheated by pirates, that he
was now made more than ordinarily cautious, and he
repeated his signals, and waited many hours, either to
have them answered, or to force the people of the
distressed ship to launch their boat and come alongside
his vessel: but neither the one thing or the other was
done.</p>

<p>“These fellows can’t be cheats,” he said, “else they
would have sailed away, though, it strikes me, it would
be difficult for them to spread a sail on those yards of
theirs,” said the commander, as his good feelings began
to press upon him.</p>

<p>“They may be starved to death, or ill, have a boat
launched, sir,” said he to the officer, after this short
soliloquy, “and let them pull to those poor fellows.
Tell the officer he must not let any of the men go on
board, he may do so himself, if he thinks it necessary.”</p>

<p>Joyfully the true-hearted sailors, eager to succour
their suffering brothers, lowered a boat, which a moment
afterwards was bounding away in the direction of the
distressed vessel.</p>

<p>They soon approached near enough to admit of speaking,
and at his order, the men rested on their oars to
allow the midshipman in command to hail the barque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“What ship is that?” asked the midshipman.</p>

<p>“The Sting,” answered the solitary individual, who
was standing at the gangway.</p>

<p>“Where from, and whither bound?”</p>

<p>“From Pernambuco to Liverpool,” answered the individual.</p>

<p>“What cargo?” demanded the midshipman.</p>

<p>“Cayenne pepper,” answered the individual.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” asked the midshipman.</p>

<p>“Have been boarded by pirates—by a Black Schooner—men
cut down in defending the vessel—the pirates
left but me and another man, who is now ill below—they
took away every thing,” answered the individual.</p>

<p>“It must be those same devils of pirates,” whispered
the boatmen one to the other, “who have raked that
cove; what fellows they seem to be, we will singe them
some of those days though—be damn’d if we don’t.”</p>

<p>“If you would only let one of your men come on
board for a moment to help me trim the yards, I
should be all right,” added the individual at the gangway.</p>

<p>“Hum!” muttered the young midshipman; “that’s
not much, but I fancy, old boy, you will do yourself no
good in setting your sails, unless you wish the wind to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
help you take them in. Pull along side, men,” he said, after
a second or two, “I shall go on deck and help him.”</p>

<p>The boat soon boarded the vessel.</p>

<p>“Keep the boat off,” said the officer, as he grasped the
ropes of the steps.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” said the boatswain, and the boat was
shoved off from the vessel.</p>

<p>A shrill sound was heard, the apparent sides of the
distressed barque opened, the stern fell heavily into the
water, the racketty yards and old ropes went over the side,
and from amidst the wreck of the skeleton ship, the Black
Schooner sprang forth as she felt the power of her snow-white
sails, which, with the rapidity of lightning, had
now clothed her tall masts.</p>

<p>This metamorphosis was so sudden, that the schooner
had already begun to move before the boatmen comprehended
the change. They quickly pulled alongside, and
fastened their hooks, but no hand of man could hold
them. They were all torn away by the speed with which
the schooner went. Every man in his turn let go his
hold, and the boat, with its angry crew, was left
floating far behind in the wake of the flying schooner.</p>

<p>After he had been defeated by the untoward accident
of the shark in his attempt to rescue his captive
chief, Lorenzo betook himself on board the schooner, a
victim to disappointment and disgust.</p>

<p>He felt irresistibly inclined to break out in the most
violent terms, and hurried down into his cabin as soon
as he got on the deck of the schooner. He then partially
gave vent to his feelings by speaking almost
aloud.</p>

<p>“It would have been bearable,” he said, “bearable, if
we had fought, and had been driven back; but to be
foiled at the very moment when we were completing a
breach, by a brute of a shark: confound it, and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
other sharks, the brutes!” and thrusting his hand
deeply into the bosom of his coat, he paced rapidly up and
down his narrow cabin, while, from time to time, his lips
moved violently as if he were repeating his anathemas
against the particular shark and all the others.</p>

<p>This fit, however, did not continue long.</p>

<p>Schooled under the continual insecurity and danger
which attended the life that he led, in which safety
itself demanded the exercise of the greatest foresight
and calmness, he speedily curbed his instinctive impulses
of rage, and immediately began to deliberate with coolness
and precision on the next measures which it was
requisite for him to take.</p>

<p>He did not deliberate long. Accustomed to act in
the face of danger, and to oppose his ready resources to
sudden contingencies, he never required much time to
debate with himself on the best and most prudent course
to be adopted under unforeseen circumstances of danger.
At this conjuncture, he resolved to watch the man-of-war
closely, and to embrace the very first opportunity
either to steal away Appadocca, or to rescue him at a
calculated sacrifice of some of his men. For that purpose,
the schooner was kept in the same position in which
she was, until, as we have seen, the man-of-war made
the descent upon her. Lorenzo purposely awaited the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
approach of the large vessel, so that he might have the
opportunity of keeping, as he intended, close to the
man-of-war. Nothing ever escaped the disciplined
vigilance of the pirates, and although they seemed to be
taken by surprise, still they had their eyes all the time
on the movements of the pursuing vessel; and, as the
reader has seen, disappointed so signally the encouraged
expectations of its crew and commander.</p>

<p>When night had put an end to the chase of that day,
Lorenzo put his men busily at work.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the ordinary sails of the Black
Schooner were symmetrically folded within the smallest
imaginable size, and carefully covered up at the foot of
each of the masts, and from under the deck, yards,
cordage, and sails for a square-rigged vessel were brought
up, and, in as short a time, the thin tapering masts were
seen garnished with the numerous ropes, yards, and sails
of a full-rigged brig; while, to complete the metamorphosis,
stripes of new canvass were carefully cut in the
shape of the imitation port-holes, which are generally
painted on the sides of merchant vessels, and were closely
fastened to the sides of the Black Schooner, and adjusted
in such a careful manner as to conceal completely the
guns of the disguised vessel.</p>

<p>It was in this guise that the Black Schooner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
passed before the man-of-war, and showed Mexican
colors.</p>

<p>After Lorenzo had closely reconnoitered his pursuer,
and had raised the suspicion which procured him the
salute of a gun, he again sailed away out of sight, and
with the same expedition as of the night before, the
mainmast of the apparent brig was immediately divested
of its yards, and, in their places, the sharp sails of a
schooner were again set. In the rig of a brigantine, the
Black Schooner again passed before the man-of-war.</p>

<p>But these distant surveys, for caution prevented him
from going within the range of the ship’s guns, were not
sufficient to satisfy Lorenzo, who now began to suffer
under the most impatient anxiety with regard to the
safety of his chief and friend.</p>

<p>The brave officer feared, that annoyed by his inability
to overtake the schooner, the commander of the ship
might, perhaps, have immediately ordered the execution
of his prisoner; that Appadocca might, by that time,
have been dealt with in the summary manner in which
pirates were usually treated, and had been hanged on
the yard-arm without accusation, hearing, or judgment.</p>

<p>“If so,” cried Lorenzo, as this fear grew more and
more upon him, “if so, I swear, by the living G—d, that
I shall burn that large vessel to the very keel, and shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
not spare one, not a single one of its numerous crew to
tell the tale—cost what it may, by G—d, I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>To procure information, therefore, about the fate of
one whom he loved as a brother: and in order to satisfy
his doubts, he resolved at once on taking one or two of
the man-of-war’s men, and settled on the expedient of
the distressed barque, with which the reader has just
been made acquainted.</p>

<p>The young midshipman had no sooner laid his foot on
the deck of the disguised schooner, before he was strongly
grasped by the powerful arm of a man who had been
carefully concealed behind the false bulwarks of the
skeleton barque, while the voice of Jim Splice—it was
the man—whispered in his ear,—</p>

<p>“Don’t resist, young countryman, all right.”</p>

<p>But as soon as the first impulse of the young officer
had passed away, and he discovered that he was left on
board a vessel which presented an unmistakable appearance
of being engaged in some forbidden trade, and
when he saw before him numbers of fierce-looking,
armed men, he struggled for a moment, and succeeded
in drawing his sword. But Lorenzo, the formerly
solitary man on the deck of the distressed vessel, calmly
stepped up to him, and said,—</p>

<p>“Young gentleman, be not alarmed, no violence will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
be done to you: sheath your sword,” and casting his
eyes around on the men, continued, “you see, it will
not be of much service to you against such odds.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” peevishly inquired the young
officer, “what do you intend to do with me?”</p>

<p>“I shall soon tell you,” replied Lorenzo, “if you will
be good enough to accompany me to my cabin.”</p>

<p>“What cabin? and what to do? You may cut my
throat here,” said the midshipman, angrily.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would not be so unreasonable,” remarked
Lorenzo, softly, “if you were to hear the little
that I have to inquire of you: pray, come with me.”</p>

<p>“I shall not go with you,” angrily rejoined the midshipman,
“I am in the hands of pirates, I know. You
may murder me, where I am, but I shall not go down
with you to any cabin.”</p>

<p>“Then stay where you are,” coolly answered Lorenzo,
and he walked away to the after part of the schooner,
and ordered Jim Splice to let go the young man.</p>

<p>The older sailor relaxed his grasp, but availed himself
of the opportunity which he now had, to whisper in
the ears of the midshipman—</p>

<p>“Don’t attempt to crow too high here, shipmate,
else you will get the worst of it, ’d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>And the old tar winked his eye to the young midshipman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
The familiar sign of knowingness contrasted
strangely with the terrible moustachios and beard with
which Jim Splice had deemed it characteristic to ornament
his homely and good-natured old face.</p>

<p>In the mean time all sail was set, and the man-of-war
was left far behind. The sailors had now again posted
themselves at their regular stations, and the ordinary
quiet had now succeeded to the short excitement of
making sail. The midshipman was still standing in the
same spot where Lorenzo had left him. His anger,
however, had evaporated to a considerable extent, under
the wise prescription of leaving the angry man to himself,
which Lorenzo was wise enough to make, and like
all men who are not absolutely fools, the midshipman
had thrown off as much as possible of that wasting and
useless attendant—rage, as soon as his first impulses had
somewhat subsided.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing in that dogged sulkiness, in
which he had been left by Lorenzo, he was now examining,
with an interested eye, the make, rigging, and
equipment of the strange schooner.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a steward approached him,
and inquired if he was then at leisure to attend his
master in his cabin, and led the way to the part of the
vessel in which that was situated. The midshipman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
without answering, followed. Lorenzo was already
there, waiting for him. The officer politely stood,
bowed to the stranger, pointed to a cabin chair: the
midshipman seated himself.</p>

<p>“Before mentioning the business for which I have
entrapped you, young gentleman,” said Lorenzo, “I
must tell you, that you need be under no apprehension
as long as you are on board this schooner, and that you
shall receive the proper treatment that one gentleman
owes to another, unless, it is understood, you force us,
by your own conduct, to act otherwise than we usually
do.”</p>

<p>“Gentleman! how dare you compare yourself to me,
and call yourself a gentleman?” said the midshipman,
with more of impulse than of reason.</p>

<p>Like one who has disciplined his mind to pursue his
purposes with a stedfast straightness which is not to be
diverted by any accident, though not, perhaps, without
some disdain for the immoderation of the young man,
the pirate officer heeded not his last remark, but proceeded
as if he had not heard it.</p>

<p>“My purpose for enticing you on board this vessel, is
to procure information about my chief, who is now a
prisoner on board the ship to which you belong. You
will be good enough to give clear and categorical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
answers to the questions which I shall put to
you.”</p>

<p>This was said in a firm, although cool tone.</p>

<p>“What? do you imagine,” inquired the young officer,
with scorn, “I am going to tell to a pirate what takes
place on board a vessel in which I have the honor to
serve? By Jove, no!—it is hard enough to be kidnapped
by a set of rascals, without being asked to play
traitor and spy, to boot. But—”</p>

<p>“Cease this nonsense,” interposed Lorenzo, “you
waste time, answer me first, is Appadocca alive?”</p>

<p>“I shall not give you any information,” peevishly
replied the young officer.</p>

<p>“I do not see,” remarked Lorenzo, mildly, and almost
paternally, “I do not see that it can possibly affect your
honor if you give me a very simple answer to a very
simple question. I ask, if Emmanuel Appadocca is
alive?”</p>

<p>“I shall answer you nothing,” said the midshipman,
insultingly.</p>

<p>“Shall answer me nothing,” calmly echoed Lorenzo,
while, like the still and steady terrors of an earthquake,
the signs of anger were now fast gathering on his brow.
He reflected a moment.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said firmly, “men do not usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
speak with negatives to me, or such as I am. You seem
disposed to run great risks—risks, of the nature of which
you are not, perhaps, aware. Let me caution you again;
I put my former question,—is the captain of this
schooner, who is now a prisoner on board the ship to
which you belong, alive and safe?”</p>

<p>“I have said I shall answer none of your questions,”
replied the midshipman, “trouble me no more.”</p>

<p>The pirate officer rose, and drew forth a massive gold
watch.</p>

<p>“You see,” said he, pointing to the time-piece, “that
the minute-hand is now on twelve, when it reaches the
spot which marks the quarter-of-an-hour, I shall expect
an answer. In the meantime make your reflections.
If you wish for any refreshment speak to the man outside,
and you shall have whatever you desire.” So saying,
the officer rose, made a slight bow, and left the cabin.</p>

<p>The young officer being left alone, seemed by no
means inclined to trouble himself about the last speech
of the pirate officer. He moved about the cabin restlessly.
Sometimes he stopped to examine one object, and
then another.</p>

<p>No further thought than that of the moment seemed
to intrude on his mind; and the consequence of his persistence
in refusing to answer the questions of the pirate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
officer never seemed to break in upon him. The levity
of youth was, perhaps, one of the principal causes of this
strange carelessness. He was also highly swayed by the
notions which he had gathered from among those in
whose society he lived. These led him to entertain an
extravagant idea of his own importance, which, among
other things, could not admit of accepting terms from
the officer of any nation that was lower than his own,
and, least of all, from a villainous pirate. He, therefore,
affected to treat the pirate officer with a contempt,
which it was as inexpedient to show, as it was silly to
entertain.</p>

<p>He was moving about in the temper which we have
described, when the door of the cabin opened, and
Lorenzo entered. He moved up to the upper part of
the cabin, and seated himself.</p>

<p>“Will you now answer my question?” he demanded,
“the hand is on the quarter.”</p>

<p>“I have already told you, no,” replied the youth.</p>

<p>Lorenzo called—an attendant appeared.</p>

<p>“Let the officer of the watch send down four men,”
he said.</p>

<p>The attendant retired. In a few moments four men,
under the command of a junior officer, entered the cabin.
Lorenzo stood—pointed to the midshipman—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Torture him until he speaks,” he said, and abruptly
left the cabin.</p>

<p>The pirates silently advanced on their victim.</p>

<p>“The first man that dares approach me, shall die
under this sword,” shrieked the midshipman, furiously,
and brandished his sword, madly. Still the pirates
advanced more closely to him. They beat down his
guard, surrounded him, and, in the twinkling of an eye,
he was bound hand and foot. Lifting him bodily, the
pirates carried him on their shoulders out of the cabin.</p>

<p>He was then taken to a narrow compartment at the
very bows of the vessel, that was, it seemed, the torture-room.</p>

<p>The appearance of the room was sufficient to strike
one at once with an idea of the bloody and cruel deeds
that might be perpetrated there. It was a narrow cabin
into which the light could never penetrate; for there
was no opening either for that or for fresh air. The
small door which led into it was narrow and low: it
turned on a spring, and seemed so difficult to be opened,
that one was forced to imagine that it was either loth to
let out those that had once got in, or that it was
eager to close in for ever upon those that might enter
through it.</p>

<p>The deck was scoured as white as chalk, and, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
shops of cleanly butchers in the morning, was scattered
over with sand. The sides of the cabin, as if to augment
the darkness that already reigned, were painted a
dark, sombre, and gloomy colour, which was here and
there stained by the damp.</p>

<p>In contrast to this prevalent hue of frightful black,
hung a variety of exquisitely-polished torturing instruments.
Cruelty, or expediency, or necessity, seems to
have exhausted its power of invention in designing them,
so different were they in form, and so horridly suited to
the purpose of giving pain.</p>

<p>These seemed to frown malignantly on those who
entered that narrow place; and the imagination might
even trace, in their burnished hue, and high efficient
condition, a morbid desire, or longing, to be used.</p>

<p>To make the “darkness visible,” and to reveal the
horror of the place, an old bronzed lamp hung from
the beams of the upper deck, and threw a faint and
sickly light around.</p>

<p>In the centre of this cabin lay a long, narrow, and
deep box, which was garnished within with millions of
sharp-pointed spikes. The torture which the victim
suffered in this machine, was a continued pricking from
the spikes, against which he was every moment suddenly
and violently driven by the lurching of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>In this the midshipman was immediately thrown, and
he shrieked the shriek of the dying when he was roughly
thrown on the sharp instruments.</p>

<p>“Hell! hell! the torments of hell,” he yelled out, as
the sharp spikes pierced him to the quick.</p>

<p>As he made an effort to turn, he increased his agony,
and as the vessel heaved, the points went deeper and
deeper into his flesh.</p>

<p>Already the suffering of the young man was at its
height, and by the livid light of the glimmering lamp,
large drops of death-like sweat, could now be seen
flowing over his pallid face, which was locked in excruciating
pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” he cried, frantic with suffering, “Heaven
save me.”</p>

<p>His executioners stood around immovable, calm, and
fierce, as they always were, more like demons sucking
in the pleasure of mortals’ pains, than men.</p>

<p>The young man seemed maddened with pain, his
shrieks pierced through even the close sides of the
torture-room.</p>

<p>“Will you speak?” inquired the officer.</p>

<p>“Yes—no. Oh, good God! No—yes: curse you
all—you devils; you demons—d—n you,” were the
frenzied replies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>An hour passed; his pains and shrieks continued;
albeit the latter now grew fainter and fewer. Nature
could endure no more; his nervous system sank under
pain and exhaustion, and he swooned.</p>

<p>The pirates removed him, and plied him with restoratives,
and he gradually revived.</p>

<p>The suffering of the midshipman had produced a
weakening effect upon him, such as disease produces on
the strongest minds; it had destroyed his hot and fierce
spirit. Yes, the pain of the body had conquered the
resolution of the mind, and after the first torturing, the
young officer was less spirited, less boisterous, and less
impatient.</p>

<p>Animation had scarcely returned, when the wretched
victim was again thrown on the spikes which, piercing
through his fresh wounds, added still more to the agony
which he had before endured. The pain this time was
not bearable.</p>

<p>“Oh! save me from this,” the young man cried, convulsively,
“kill me at once.”</p>

<p>“We want not your life, what good is that to us?”
replied the junior officer in command of the pirates, “we
wish only to hear about our captain, who may be at this
moment undergoing the same pains as you.”</p>

<p>“Then remove me, and I shall speak. No, yes, no, yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“You will then cease to play the fool at your own
cost,” was the laconic and unsympathising reply of the
above-mentioned officer, who, at the same time, dispatched
one of his men to report that the prisoner was
willing to speak.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, in a few moments, crept into the narrow
room.</p>

<p>“Will you now answer my question?” he inquired
of the victim.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is the captain alive and safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What are the intentions of your captain about
him?”</p>

<p>“To—oh! take me away from these spikes: oh! these
cursed spikes.”</p>

<p>“Speak.”</p>

<p>“To take him to Trinidad, to be tried.”</p>

<p>“When is your ship to direct her course to that
place?—Take him out, men.”</p>

<p>The victim was taken out.</p>

<p>“She was—oh! what happiness—she was to do so,
to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough. Young man, I admire your spirit:
it might be developed into something useful under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
proper discipline; as you are, at present, you are only a
slave of impulses, that are as wild as your original self.
Take him to the surgeon’s room.”</p>

<p>Giving this order to his men, Lorenzo left the cabin
of torture.</p>

<p>When the men of the man-of-war pulled on board,
after their young officer had been entrapped into the
schooner, and reported the occurrence to the commander,
notwithstanding the great command which, considering
his life and avocation, he had over himself, he flew into
a violent passion. The success which had, up to that
time, attended the pirates, either in flying from him, or
in outwitting him, had already tried his patience to the
utmost. To have met an enemy equally armed, to have
tried the fortune of a fight with him, and to have been
beaten would not, perhaps, have had such a mortifying
effect on the mind of the old commander as to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
subjected to the tantalizing deceptions and mocking
cunning of the pirates.</p>

<p>He walked the deck as furiously as his gouty old
limbs would carry him, and spoke to himself in a voice
that was hoarse with passion.</p>

<p>“First,” said he, “the blackguards waited until I was
just about to give the order to fire, and then sprang out
of my reach. Then their d—n—d schooner sailed so
fast, and this tub of a thing was so slow, that by G—d,
by making the masts creak again, I could not force her
to move faster; while all the time those d—n—d
villains were playing about me, and amusing themselves
at my expense: the devil take them. Then the rascals
went, and took down their own sails, and rigged themselves
up in a brig’s canvass, and passed by me—fool as
I was. I showed the blackguards bunting, instead of
sending a broad-side into them at once, d—n them; and
now, at noon-day, when the sun is high in the heavens,
when every man can see fifty miles before him, I have
let those rascals come almost alongside, and kidnap one
of my officers. D—n them, d—n them.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Charles,” continued the old
gentleman, red in the face with rage, “the weight of a
feather in my mind would make me hang—by G—d,
yes—hang at once that astronomical friend of yours;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
hang, I say, on one yard-arm, and that d—n—d rascally
looking father of his on the other: for it is these fellows,
d—n them, that have been the cause of my being
insulted and duped by a set of ruffianly cut-throats,”
and the old man walked the deck even still more violently
than before.</p>

<p>His son, who had listened to this explosion, was too
prudent to interrupt it or to reply to it.</p>

<p>He knew his father: he knew that, like the generality
of persons of a warm, generous, frank and open disposition,
his outbreaks were as furious and unmeaning, while
they lasted, as they were short-lived; he, therefore,
remained silent, and permitted the fit to exhaust
itself.</p>

<p>“Hark you,” continued the commander in a tone
that indicated a subsiding of the paroxysm, “let the
course of the vessel be changed immediately, and let us
go to Trinidad. I shall not be lumbered with rascally
pirates, and villainous planters, on board my ship. My
vessel was made to fight better foes than these scurvy
sea-thieves. Crowd on canvass, crowd on canvass, and
let us steer for Trinidad at once, and deliver these foul
fellows into the hands of the lawyers. But first, call up
that friend of yours: a fine companion for a British
officer, Mr. Charles—a very fine companion!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“You forget, sir,” meekly remarked his son, “that
when I knew Appadocca he was not a pirate.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, that will do, let the man be brought
before me.”</p>

<p>In a short time Appadocca, under the charge of two
marines, was led into the presence of the commander.</p>

<p>Imprisonment and anxiety, if he was still capable of
of feeling the latter, seemed to have had no effect upon
him. His calmness, his cynicism was the same. Solitude,
which to other men is at best but dreary, and is
ordinarily but the provocative of reflections which may,
perhaps, be embittered by the events and scenes which
they recall—solitude which, to Appadocca in particular,
one might suppose could have been only an encouragement
to musings, which were likely to be attended if not
with sorrow, at least with but little happiness, appeared
to have had no effect on him. He seemed, if we can use
the expression, but to enjoy his own misanthropic seclusion,
and as for the circumstance that he was a prisoner,
that made no change in him. He looked upon every
position with the eye of fatalism, ay, and of that fatalism
which does not arise from the obligation of any religious
creed, but which is the tasteless fruit of a long series of
disappointments and calamities—the fatalism of despondent
resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Such a feeling has influenced more than one mortal
in his earthly career. Full many a warrior, whose
praises are now chimed through an admiring world, has
gone forth to achieve wonders, to conquer, and to be
great, with such a sentiment rooted in his heart. Full
many a conqueror has let loose the eaglet of his ambition,
without seeing the rock or prominence on which
the still young and strengthless master of the far skies
could rest, save, indeed, the shadowy foot-hold that
hope could fancy to discover in the sombre workings
of inscrutable fate.</p>

<p>Such was the feeling of Emmanuel Appadocca, the
pirate captain: such was the strengthening thought
which buoyed and supported him in the unnatural
career into which cruelty and unkindness had drawn him,
and that idea imparted to him equanimity under all adversities,
courage and valour in the fight, unscrupulousness
in according judgment, boldness in working retribution,
and stoicism in imprisonment.</p>

<p>“Tell me, sir,” said the commander, endeavouring to
resume as much of his native dignity as his heated blood
would permit him; “tell me, sir, in what bay those
lawless men—the pirates who follow you—hide themselves,
and where I can surprise them. I expect the
truth from you, sir, although you may denounce your
associates by speaking it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>The lips of Appadocca curled a little.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he answered, “as long as I was on board
my schooner, we sought no other shelter than that which
was afforded us by the high and wide seas.”</p>

<p>The commander looked at Appadocca fiercely in the
eyes.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry,” he said, “to suspect you of falsehood
or prevarication, since you have been the fellow-student
of my son: but your answer is vague and
unsatisfactory. Do you mean to say that you have no
harbour, no creek whither you were accustomed to
resort, after your piratical cruizes?”</p>

<p>“None, my lord: after our ‘piratical cruizes,’ as you,
I dare say justly, call them, we were in the habit of
taking our booty for sale to the nearest port and of depending
upon our own skill and watchfulness for safety.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” muttered the commander, after a pause,
“you are aware, sir, that one of my officers has been
kidnapped by your rascally associates, as I presume them
to be,” continued the commander, with his temper evidently
breaking through the composed dignity which he
endeavoured to retain.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, the punishment that I should feel justified
in inflicting upon you, would be to have you hanged, at
once, on that yard,” and he pointed to the main yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“My lord,” calmly replied Appadocca, “I am in your
power, the yard is before you, you have men at your
command, do whatever you may choose with me.”</p>

<p>The commander looked at him steadfastly for a
moment or two.</p>

<p>“D—n him!” he muttered, and turned away.</p>

<p>The frankness and generosity of his nature were again
gaining ground upon his temper.</p>

<p>“I should not like to have anything to do with
the death of this fellow, after all. It is a pity that
his bravery is thrown away among those rascally devils,”
he whispered to his son. Then, addressing the two
men who guarded Appadocca, “take the prisoner away.
See that canvass be put on the ship, and steer for the
Island of Trinidad, Mr. Charles.”</p>

<p>“If you will allow me the liberty, my lord,” said
Appadocca, as the marines were about to lead him away,
“I would tell your lordship that you need be under no
apprehension on account of your officer: we are not in
the habit of using violence, or of ill-treating our captives
when there is no occasion for doing so.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” groaned the commander somewhat incredulously.</p>

<p>“And, if you allow me, my lord, I shall request my
officer to be especially careful of putting any restraint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
whatever upon your midshipman,” continued Appadocca.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean, sir?” briskly inquired
the commander, “do you wish to insult me?”</p>

<p>“By no means, my lord,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>“And how do you tell me, then,” continued the commander,
“that you will ‘request your officer,’ when there
is no officer to be requested?”</p>

<p>“Although there is no officer to be seen, my lord,”
answered Appadocca, “still I can request him: all
things can be done by a variety of ways, my lord.”</p>

<p>“How am I to understand you, sir?” inquired the
commander.</p>

<p>“Simply in this manner,” replied Appadocca, “that
if you allow me, I shall communicate with my chief
officer, and request him to take care of your officer.”</p>

<p>“And how do you propose to do so,” asked the commander,
after a considerable pause.</p>

<p>“Only with four flags,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>“What will you do with those?”</p>

<p>“I shall make signals with them.”</p>

<p>“But there is no vessel in sight.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord.”</p>

<p>“How, then, can your signals be of service?” inquired
the commander.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my lord, if I decline to answer this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
question. The sparrow by caution flies the heavens
with the hawk.”</p>

<p>“I should suppose, sir, when you have now no prospect
of ‘flying the heavens’ again,” said the commander,
“you could have no objection to give us a piece of
information, which cannot but be serviceable to us.
However, make the signals, sir. Bring four flags
there.”</p>

<p>Appadocca took the flags and adjusted them in a
particular manner on the line.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the commander, when they were about
to be hoisted. “What warrant have I that you will not
say more than is necessary?” he inquired of Appadocca.</p>

<p>“None, my lord, except my word,” cooly replied
Appadocca, “if you consider this of any value, take it,
if not, reject it. But recollect, my lord, if I had been
inclined to be a deceiver, I should have remained in the
society of mankind, and should have prospered by coating
over my rascality with the varnish either of mock
benevolence or of sanctimony; I should not have openly
braved the strength and ordinary notions of the world.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir, proceed,” said the commander.</p>

<p>“Within a few minutes after the completion of the
signals, you will hear the answer—the report of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
guns fired at the same time,” said Appadocca, and made
a sign to hoist.</p>

<p>“What is the fellow going to do?” inquired the
sailors one of the other.</p>

<p>“He is going to speak to the ‘old boy,’ I suppose,”
answered one.</p>

<p>“He won’t do him much good, I fancy,” remarked the
other.</p>

<p>“No, he will leave him in the hands of the landsharks,
I guess,” said another.</p>

<p>In the mean time, continuing to make the signals,
Appadocca adjusted and re-adjusted the four flags in a
great variety of ways, and, at last, said to the commander:—</p>

<p>“Now, my lord, listen.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the report of distant guns fell on
the ear.</p>

<p>“Magic, by G—d!” each sailor exclaimed.</p>

<p>“How very strange,” the commander remarked.</p>

<p>“Bring up all the glasses, there,” he said, “and send
up there Charles, and see where that firing comes
from.”</p>

<p>Men immediately climbed the masts, and surveyed the
horizon. No telescope of the man-of-war could discover
whence came the report of the guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>After this Appadocca was led back to his cabin, and
sails were put on the huge vessel that now began to
move majestically through the water.</p>

<p>There is a soft and sweet pleasure in sailing among
the West India Islands. He who has not sailed in the
Caribean sea, he who has not stood on the deck of his
gliding vessel, and felt the cooling freshness of the trade
winds, and seen the white winged birds plunge and rise
in silent gracefulness, he who has not marked the shining
dolphin in its playing course, and seen the transparent
foam rise and melt before the scattering breeze,
with the blue waters below, a high smiling sky above,
and the rich uninterrupted beams of a fierce and powerful
sun, gilding the scene, can scarcely say that he
knows what nature is. For, he who has not seen the
tropics has not seen her as she is in her most perfect form.</p>

<p>The ship held her course through the waters which,
reflecting the rays of the sun, undulated like a sheet of
molten silver, in which she seemed but the gathered
dross floating on its surface. As she moved and broke
that shining surface, the waters frothed for a time about
her and then closed in smoothness again; while the sea
birds playfully gathered in the silvery wake, the weeds
which shone, like golden drops, in the pebbly bed of
some clear and limped stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>With nature smiling thus around him, with the silence
which brings not gloom surrounding him, with the
balmy breeze rising fresh and sweet from the bosom of
the waters, fanning him into contemplation, the hardest-natured
man must feel if only for a moment, the chastening
quietude, which only nature, and he who is mirrored
in nature, can impart and bestow.</p>

<p>The bosom in which the snakes of envy or hatred
have long nestled and brooded, may feel itself relieved of
half its oppression and suffering whilst gazing at nature’s
beautiful works, as manifested among the islands of the
tropics, and beholding in its embodiment of splendour
the omnipotence of the Creator. How many a heart
whose life-blood has been frozen under the influence of
ingratitude, cruelty, revenge, and pride, or, perhaps,
of the sad consciousness of a country’s thankfulness—a
country in whose cause youth, energy, wealth, and
talents—may all have been spent, has not been
soothed into mild quiescence by scenes like these?</p>

<p>There are countries around which the works of man
have thrown a veil of enchantment; there are climes
that are sacred, because some Heaven-born poet sang
there; there are spots about which the memory of
mankind has clung, and will for ever cling: such
countries and such places are made famous, great and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
enchanting by man alone. Their beauties sprang from
his hand. The idea which plants on them the ever-enduring
standard of veneration arose from his valour,
his heroism, or perhaps his benevolence, but whatever
charm or interest the tropics possess they derive from
nature, and from nature only.</p>

<p>For three days together, the ship continued her
course, amidst the horse-shoe formed islands of the
West-Indian Archipelago, which, at a distance at sea,
appear merely like heavy clouds where nothing is real,
nothing is animated, resting on the surface of the
waters.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth, the towering mountain-peaks
of Trinidad which inspired in the devout
Columbus, the name which the island now bears, appeared
in sight.</p>

<p>Gradually the bold and rocky coast which girds the
island on the north, grew more and more distinct and
as the day waned, the ship entered the channel that
separates the small island of Tobago from Trinidad, and
bears the name of the latter.</p>

<p>The old commander, with necessary caution, ordered
the greater part of the sails to be taken in; the vessel
moved along slowly, and was borne down principally
by the strength of the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>The commander stood on the quarter-deck admiring
the romantic scenery which presented itself on the left
to his view. There the overhanging rocks rose perpendicularly
from the heaving ocean, whose long lasting
and lashing billows broke on their rugged base, and
shrouded them in one constant sheet of white bubbling
foam, and as they towered and seemed to lose themselves
in the clouds, they bore on their hoary heads
forests of gigantic trees, whose many colored blossoms
appeared far out at sea; while down their furrowed
sides torrents of the purest water fell foaming in angry
precipitance. Here some cave hollowed by no hand of
man—the home of the untiring pelicans that ply the
wing the live-long day, would send forth its hollow
murmurs, as it regurgitated some heaving rolling wave
that had intrusively swept into its inmost recess. There
some rock from whose side time had torn away its
fellows, stood naked and bare, sullen in its solitude, and
resisting the powerless waves that dashed themselves
into a thousand far-flying sprays upon its jagged front;
and here again some secluded creek, eaten deeply into
the heart of the frowning highlands, in which the waters
lay smooth and quiet, like tired soldiers after the toil
and strife of battle.</p>

<p>Such scenes might well make an impression on those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
who looked on; and even the rough weather-beaten
sailors, to whose eyes nature may have long grown
familiar, stood leaning on spar or anchor viewing the
awe-inspiring scene.</p>

<p>Among those on deck stood also James Willmington:
and what were his feelings, he whose memory had been
so recently recalled to deeds which could not render him
an easier-minded man, if they had not had the effect of
making him a better one? Nature is itself an accuser!
To the bosom where all is not right, she speaks in terror.
The trembling of a leaf, the sudden flight of a startled
insect, the gliding of a lizard appals the guilty conscience.
Could the man on whose head the crime of
huge injustice pressed heavily—the man whose cruelty
had blasted the life which he gave, and who was at that
moment conducting to the gallows, the child whom he
had begotten—could such a man mingle the stirred
sentiments of his soul with the sublime grandeur of
nature, and send them forth with the voice of the
mighty proclaimer, in mute veneration to the throne of
God. No! nature is not cruel, nature deserts not its
humblest offspring, she, therefore, could receive no
sympathy from the heart of such a man.</p>

<p>Let us now go to the cabin of Appadocca. He was
sitting on the rude accommodation which had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
afforded him, with his arms crossed over his breast, and
his earnest eyes fixed on the mountains of Paria, which
he could see on the right, through the port-hole that
admitted air and light into his cabin, and which had
now been opened, inasmuch as it was considered a
matter of impossibility for him to escape, while the ship
was under sail on the high seas.</p>

<p>He was absorbed in deep thought; and he watched
the neighbouring mountains with more and more
earnestness, as they rose higher and higher to the view,
on the gradual approach of the vessel. Twilight came,
and threw its mellow hue around. It soon departed,
and the scene, which was but a short time before enlivened
by the powerful sun, was left in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>As the ship approached the little islands of the Bocas,
nothing could be heard but the roars of the lashing
surges, as they broke at regular intervals on the rocks.</p>

<p>Night came, dark and dreary. The ship approached
the largest of the three small outlets. Every one on
board was fixed in silent attention to his duty. The
senior officer stood at the shrouds, trumpet in hand,
with the aged commander by his side. Every man was
at his post, awaiting in anxiety the command to trim
sails, in order to enter the difficult passage.</p>

<p>That was always a moment of anxiety in every vessel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
going through it; for such was its narrowness, and the
strength of the current that swept down the channel
along the Venezuelan coast, that if a ship once went but
a yard further down than where she ought to trim her
sails, and luff up through the passage, it became a labour
of many weeks to beat up against the wind and current
to the proper place.</p>

<p>The critical moment came; the ship was within the
Dragon’s Mouth; she trembled as if she had been lashed
by the tail of some sea-monster, ten times larger than
herself, as she mounted the cross chopping seas, which
always run high and heavy at that entrance to the Gulf
of Paria.</p>

<p>“Lee braces all,” the commanding officer trumpeted
forth.</p>

<p>“Luff.”</p>

<p>The ropes glided through a thousand pullies, and the
heavy chains of the tacks clanked through their iron
blocks as they were eased away. The sailors moved in
disciplined order from rope to rope, and the deck sounded
with their rolling foot-falls. The serious marine intermitted
his monotonous and limited march for a moment,
and leaned in a corner to give room to the busy mariners.</p>

<p>Appadocca had continued to sit in the same position
as we have mentioned a few lines back, from the fading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of the short twilight up to that time, which was now near
midnight.</p>

<p>Although he could not see, nevertheless he seemed
during the whole time to use his ears for the same
earnest purpose as he had done his eyes; and as soon
as he felt the heaving labours of the vessel, and heard
the noise that was made by the falling of the blocks on
the deck, he sprang from his seat like a young horse
when it is goaded.</p>

<p>“Ha! this is the time at last,” he exclaimed, in a subdued
tone, and springing towards the port-hole with one
effort of impulsive strength, he tore down its framework:
next, he grasped the stool on which he had sat.</p>

<p>“Confusion,” he cried, “it will not yield:” the stool
was tied to a ring on the deck.</p>

<p>When Appadocca discovered this, he seemed slightly
alarmed: he stood for a moment thinking how he could
unfasten the stool. To undo it with his hands was a
labour of hours, and he had nothing with which he could
cut it. His eyes quickly surveyed the cabin; he rushed
towards a basin which had been allowed him, he placed
it on the deck, and jumped upon it. With the pieces of the
brittle ware, he began to saw at the lashing of the stool.</p>

<p>It was a tedious labour, one which required an unconquerable
perseverance to overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Full ten minutes—minutes that on such occasions
are more precious than years—had expired, and he had
made scarcely any progress. As he sawed through one
fold of twine, another appeared, but still he persevered,
and blunted every piece of the broken basin in succession.</p>

<p>The stout heart and persevering hand will conquer
immensities of obstacles.</p>

<p>At last, at last, the folds were sawed through. Appadocca
seized the stool with both hands.</p>

<p>“Now for life again, and the accomplishment of
my design,” he said, and endeavoured to pitch it
through the hole, but ill-fortune stepped in again to
baulk him. The stool was too large to pass through
the opening, he tried it various ways, but with no
success.</p>

<p>“Destiny,” he calmly muttered, as he put it down
with the fortitude of a Diogenes.</p>

<p>He cast his eyes around him; there was a large
Spanish pitcher of clay, such as are used in the tropics,
in which water was brought to him: a drowning man,
they say, will grasp at a straw: he laid hold of it, he
tried it, it passed the opening.</p>

<p>“Now, farewell, good ship,” he said, and leaned over
the side of the vessel. He allowed the pitcher to fall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
quietly into the water, and he himself, plunged after it
into the unfathomable waste.</p>

<p>“A man overboard!” some one cried on deck.</p>

<p>“No, no:” said another, “it’s only the slack of the
main-brace.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

</div>

<p>On jumping into the sea, Appadocca swam dexterously
after the pitcher, which he had thrown before him;
then resting one hand upon it, and moving the other
easily through the water, he paused a moment to gaze
at the large ship that was now looming in the darkness,
and was rapidly leaving him far behind.</p>

<p>The vessel continued her course. It was evident no
one on board of her had seen his escape. He was left
alone on the sea. He now began to swim in the direction
in which long habit had taught him the coast of
Venezuela was situated. As he progressed through the
water he pushed the pitcher before him. Now and
then he paused, and rested as before, with one hand on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the pitcher, while he lightly floated himself with the
other. Hours passed, and every succeeding one found
the indefatigable Appadocca buffetting the waves with
a heart of resolution, and an eye of determination.
The thick darkness of the night was fast passing away,
the gray dawn of morning was appearing, and the dark
mountains of Venezuela began to rise to the view with
that cheating delusion which mountains at that early
hour of the morning present, and by their apparent
nearness, one moment seduce the weary oarsman into
the grateful belief that he is fast approaching the end of
his irksome labour, only to irritate him the next by their
constant and still greater recession.</p>

<p>The swimming fugitive felt encouragement and support
from these two happy circumstances. More and
more vigorously he stretched out his arms. Only three
miles now seemed to separate him from the land. The
currents and the sweep of the waves were in his
favour.</p>

<p>On, on he pushed his befriending pitcher, and swam
and rested alternately. The desperate hazard which he
had incurred in throwing himself overboard in a boiling
sea in a part where all the sharks of the neighbouring
waters assemble to feed upon the refuse that is borne
down by the gulf-current, seemed about to terminate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
happily and prosperously, and the act which at first may
have borne the appearance of a voluntary seeking of
death on his part, was about to result in deliverance
and safety.</p>

<p>Perhaps even the seared, stoical heart of the cynical
Appadocca, under these happy forebodings, throbbed
a little more highly than usual.</p>

<p>But the grounds on which pleasure and hope are
built, are too often sandy: our highest subjects of joy
and congratulation are, alas! too liable to be converted,
in the imperceptible space of a second, into those of
misery and woe. So it proved with Emmanuel Appadocca.</p>

<p>When, as we have remarked, these prospects dawned
in reality upon him, his strokes were made with more
vigour; he became, consequently, the sooner tired, and
was obliged to pause for rest more frequently.</p>

<p>After one of these intervals, after having “screwed up
his courage to the sticking point,” he gave his pitcher
a push before him. The vessel floated to a considerable
distance in front, then suddenly melted to pieces and
sank for ever.</p>

<p>The soft clay of which it was made was dissolved by
the water, and could no longer hold together.</p>

<p>If Appadocca had, a moment before, permitted his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
cynicism to incline beyond its medium point towards
joy, so now he could not prevent it from verging to an
equal distance on the opposite side. He had, but a few
minutes ago, been induced to hope that he should be
able to reach the land. Prospects of once more heading
his faithful followers warmed his heart; and the prospect,
too, of still being able to execute his design upon the
man whose heart was too bad to open to repentance and
justice from the lessons of his victim-judge, and from
the perils out of which only the sheerest hazard had
delivered him: but now, with the assisting pitcher his
hopes also sank. It was now next to impossible that he
could reach the shore; for although like the pedestrian
who, with certain intervals of rest, may walk the whole
globe, he could swim a considerably greater distance
than seven miles—the distance which now intervened
between him and the land—by now and then holding to
something which could assist him in floating until he had
rested, still it was impossible now for him to accomplish,
much fatigued as he already was, at the utmost more
than a mile; and the shore was still three miles away.
Despair, utter despair would have seized a mind that
was more susceptible of ungovernable influences, but Appadocca
made up his mind not to be drowned, and continued
to swim. He had not swum to any great distance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
when he began to experience the want of his pitcher; his
limbs began to feel exhaustion, he muttered something to
himself, and went on still; his limbs became more tired;
sensibility began to diminish; his arms grew stiffer and
stiffer; on, on, still he went; his features manifested
exhaustion, his respiration grew shorter and shorter;
already nature could bear no more; his eyeballs glared
like those of one in the last agony of drowning; his
strokes became weaker and still weaker; already he
swam more heavily; his chest sank deeper and deeper
into the water; the mountains before him began to
wheel, and pass, and vanish like clouds floating over
a mist; his vision was indistinct, and nature drooped,
exhausted with one long breathing; he was sinking,
sinking, sinking ... when ... something met his
feet, and Appadocca stood on a sunken rock with the
water to his chin.</p>

<p>Surprised to a certain extent by such an unexpected
occurrence, he at once remained where he was, fearful
less the first step he would take should lead him again into
the danger which he had, at least temporarily, escaped.</p>

<p>He stood there for a considerable time; but although
the position was one, which, on the point of drowning,
might be very advantageous, still it ceased to be so
when the immediate danger had passed; and now, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the contrary, presented another peril; for Appadocca
was now exposed, in his motionless state, to become
the prey of the very first hungry shark that might
happen to swim in that direction, and what was still
worse, he felt that the sea was every moment rising
higher and higher. It was therefore clear that he could
not stay much longer where he was. He began to
resolve, but before he could determine on any definite
resolution, a large wave broke over him; for mere safety,
he was again obliged to swim. He had not gone far,
when in spite of his strong will, his limbs would not
move. Thus with his resolution still strong, and his volition
still active, Appadocca, nevertheless, found himself
rapidly sinking.</p>

<p>“Oh! destiny,” he bubbled out, as the water now
almost choked him, “is there such a thing as destiny?”
He was sinking, sinking, sinking, when something,
something again met his feet.</p>

<p>Appadocca quickly planted his nerveless feet as firmly
as he could, upon the support which it would appear
that destiny, which he had well nigh invoked for the
last time, had again placed under them. He concluded
at once, that he had fortunately alighted on a layer of
rocks, which ran far out to sea, and of which the one
that first received him, was about the beginning. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
ascertain the correctness of his judgment he ventured,
after he had rested a little, to put one foot forward, it
rested also on the rock; the other, it rested too.</p>

<p>Appadocca now waded along towards the shore, swimming
now and then, when a larger chasm than usual intervened.
As he approached the land, however, the
rocks began to sink lower and lower, until at last he was
left without a footing. There was yet a considerable
distance between where he was, and the shore, and in
his condition, the prospect of being saved, even after
the succession of unexpected auxiliary accidents was but
slight and precarious. Nevertheless, he was obliged to
hazard all; so he began to swim again. His arms after
the rest they had had, were more powerful. On—on,
he went—closer, and closer—he drew to the land; still
the distance was immense to a well-nigh exhausted man.
His strength began again to fail; but a few strokes
Appadocca, and you are on land. His strength diminished
more and more, shadows again began to flit across
his vision, his senses reeled; he was sinking, no befriending
rock now met his feet; he disappeared....
In a moment he rose again, in the second stage of
drowning, with his features locked in despairing agony.
As he came to the surface the rolling volume of a sweeping
billow met him, carried him roughly to the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and threw him high and dry on the white sandy beach,
that was glimmering under the scorching rays of a fiery
sun.</p>

<p>The tide ebbed away and left Appadocca on that which
was now dry land. Nature was overwhelmed, and he
seemed scarcely strong enough to rally from the swoon.
There he lay, far from human succour, with the land
rising perpendicularly from the beach, for a great distance
away along the shore, and thus shutting out to
those who might inhabit that part of the country, any
immediate view of the sea, or the shore below. The
fugitive might, have lain in this state until nature, by an
effort scarcely to be expected in his condition, might
have suddenly revived, or what was the more probable,
life might have quietly departed from the miserable man,
had not the same fortune which seemed all along to befriend
him, again interposed to foster still the spark of
life which now scarcely lived in him.</p>

<p>A wild bull, maddened with fury, came bounding over
the heights. The animal was so headlong in its race, that
rushing to the ridge of the precipitous highlands, ere it
could abate its speed, it was borne away by its own impetus
over the ledge, and with a tremendous bound, it
rolled dead at the foot of the still insensible Appadocca.</p>

<p>In a few moments two horsemen appeared above, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
reining up their horses carefully at the edge, looked down
on the late object of their chase. They were children
of the Savannahs—the Bedouins of South America.
They were two Llaneros, their lassos were coiled in wide
circles round one arm, while with the other, they clutched
a short spear and the powerful reins with which they
governed their still unbroken horses. They looked carefully
at the now motionless animal, which but a second
before careered so proudly over the plain, and was so
formidable to them, shrugged their shoulders, and were
turning their horses’ heads to return, when the attention
of one of them, seemed attracted by an object at the
foot of which the body of the dead bull lay.</p>

<p>“Es un hombre—’Tis a man,” both of them said, with
great excitement. “’Tis a man, go you and look at
him, Juancito.”</p>

<p>One dismounted, and, leaving his horse in charge of
the other, scrambled down the rocks to the beach. He
examined the body and cried out to his companion above,
that life was still in it.</p>

<p>“Esta un hombre de cualidad, he is a great man,” he
added.</p>

<p>Moved by their spirit of native hospitality, and partly
influenced by the not unselfish motive of saving the life
of a great man, the two Llaneros began to devise the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
means of getting Appadocca on the dry land above, and
of conveying him to the house of the Ranchero, whose
oxen they tended. But it was next to impossible to
carry him up those rocks on which only the most steady-footed
could manage to move; besides, it was necessary
for one to remain above to hold the horses which, unguarded
and unrestrained, would have obeyed their
strong instinct and scampered off to their native
wilds.</p>

<p>In this difficulty the natural recourse of the Llaneros
was to their lassos. But those could scarcely be used,
as the projections of the rocks would have shattered
in a thousand pieces the person whom they designed to
save, if they undertook to hoist him up along their
rugged surface. They, therefore, had to think of some
other expedient: but no other occurred to them, and they
were obliged to recur to their lassos, in the use of which
they were so long and perfectly practiced. They
thought, however, in conjunction with the resolution of
adopting this expedient, of removing Appadocca to
another part of the beach, from which the rocks did not
rise so roughly. This was easily done, and having
fastened their lassos together, they secured one end to
Appadocca, and the other to one of the horses; one of
the Llaneros spurred the animal forward, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
other remained at the edge to guide the rope as much
as it was in his power to do.</p>

<p>By this means the still insensible Appadocca, was
brought safely on the table land. After the violent
shaking he had received, he seemed to come to himself
a little; he opened his eyes, but it was only for a
moment. He was no longer insensible, but he was
totally prostrated, and sank again into an inactive condition.
He was then placed on the saddle before
one of the Llaneros, and they rode off towards the
house, whose roof could be barely discerned from amidst
the clustering branches of the trees by which it was
surrounded.</p>

<p>The Llaneros soon alighted at the door, where they
were met by the Ranchero, and the insensible stranger
was carried in.</p>

<p>Like all the houses of the Ranchas of South America,
this was an extensive wooden building, built of only
one storey—a necessary measure against the ravages of
the frequent earthquakes which shake so terribly those
tropical regions.</p>

<p>The large and shady fronds of the beautiful palms
that decorate the level and grassy Savannahs, were
cleverly sewn together to form a covering, which was as
effectual in excluding the dews and rains, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
in itself romantic. No ceiling concealed the beams
and rafters which supported this primitive roof; but
from the exigences of the climate, and probably from
the unwillingness to raise highly finished structures in
the wilds, where the inhabitant scarcely ever saw the
face of any one beside those of the Llaneros who tended
his numerous and half-wild herds, the space between
the low flooring and the roof was entirely unoccupied.
The apartments were extensive, and as airy as such a
climate required. Windows opened in all directions,
and the winds of heaven swept freely through every
crevice of the house. The furniture seemed to be as
simple and as primitive as the building that contained
it. A few heavy chairs, made of the hides of the oxen,
that formed the wealth of the Ranchero, were placed
about, here and there, more for the service of the few
individuals who occupied the place, than for the accommodation
of visitors or strangers, both of whom were
exceedingly rare, if ever seen in those solitary wilds.
Indian hammocks hung in several places, and moved to
and fro, before the power of the wind that blew into the
apartment; and on supports from the walls, rested beautiful
Spanish saddles, whose bows and stirrups of
massive silver, attracted immediate attention. Around
the house stood some magnificent trees, under the shady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
boughs of which, herds of oxen, which were partially
reclaimed from the wild state in which they had been
bred, now quietly chewed their cud, not without, however,
casting from time to time, a wistful look on the
strong pallisades that fenced them in. Wild looking
undressed horses, restively cropped the short grass that
grew around the house, and now and then tugged with
evident impatience, the tethers of cowskin, that
restrained their liberty.</p>

<p>Away, at a short distance from the inhabited house
itself, stood also pens for cattle, and apparently a
slaughter-house, on whose roof the large heavy vultures
of South America, pressed and fought and nibbled
each other for a footing, while around it were strewed
a thousand horns, the spoils of the fierce natives of the
plains, that had fallen there under the Picador’s knife.
To complete the peculiarity of the scene a few half
naked and fierce looking individuals, loitered here and
there, carelessly smoking their cigars; or leaned against
the fences, and criticised the ruminating oxen within,
as objects among which their entire life had been spent,
and with such apparent skill and earnestness, as to leave
one to fancy that the world contained nothing that
deserved so much interest in their estimation as the
animals which formed the tissue of their associations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and of their fathers’ before them. The horses that were
tied in their rude accoutrements, to the posts of the
fences, and the huge spurs of solid silver, which were
tightly thonged to the naked heels of those men, showed
that they belonged entirely to the plains, and were probably
there, only for the purpose of receiving the orders
of the master.</p>

<p>“Feliciana,” cried the Ranchero, as Appadocca was
carried into the large chamber that formed, what in
Europe, would be called the with-drawing room—“Feliciana
ben aca,—Feliciana, come hither.”</p>

<p>At this call, a beautiful young lady appeared, and
started back as she beheld the pallid, wasted, and haggard,
but still beautiful face of Appadocca, while, at the
same time, the low interjection of “Jesu!” escaped her
lips.</p>

<p>“Que se haga todo necessario por ese infeliz,” “Let
every thing be done for this unhappy man,” said the
Ranchero, who even in the half barbarous life that he
led, did not entirely lose the distinguishing politeness
of his people.</p>

<p>Appadocca, under the care of the fair Venezuelan,
was carried into an extensive chamber, which was much
more comfortable than any one would have imagined
any part of the house could be. He was laid on a couch
that was unornamented, but that was as white as the
flock of the cotton-tree. It was not to rest, however,
that he was thus accommodated. His fatigues and
privations overpowered the strength which his peculiar
philosophy had tended to maintain, and the movement
and exercise of the hoisting, and transporting on horseback,
had completed what they had begun. He was
seized with a violent fever, which now terribly manifested
itself in the wildest ravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>Alarmed at the state of the stranger, Feliciana called
every one into service. Peons flew here and there and
everywhere, for herbs and weeds, while she herself
remained by the bedside of the delirious sick man, watching
every movement that he made, and listening to
every word that he uttered.</p>

<p>Nature overcame even this passing madness, and
Appadocca fell into a light slumber. Feliciana, with
looks even more serious than when she went to attend
her unknown patient, left the apartment.</p>

<p>Feliciana was a little above the middle size, exceedingly
well formed, and majestic in her appearance.
Her face was in itself a study, on account of the many
different expressions which it wore at one and the same
time. Her forehead was large and expansive, indicative
of a large amount of intellect. Her nose was
slightly elevated at the centre, and at the same time
full and rounded at its termination; her lips were full
and well formed, while the compression which marked
the slight pout that they possessed, pointed to much
firmness of character. To heighten all these separate
individual expressions, nature had bestowed upon her
large melting eyes, that swam like the gazelle’s, in a bed
of transparent moisture, and in which, it would be difficult
to say, whether sentiment, or the serious contemplation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
of the Spanish character prevailed the
most.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, a student of physiognomy would have
pronounced, on seeing the beautiful Venezuelan, that
Heaven had bestowed on her a high degree of intellect,
a high degree of sentiment, and a high degree of firmness.
She would have been at once pronounced one
who was capable of great discernment, of forming high
designs, and of overcoming every obstacle that might
oppose their execution; while, at the same time, the
sentiment which was clearly perceptible in her eyes,
could be very accurately predicated as that, which, from
its decided prevalence and preponderance, would always
act as the leader of her mental and more solid endowments.</p>

<p>Her dress, in addition, was calculated to make these
striking features, and her handsome person still more
conspicuous. It was of dark materials, and adjusted in
a manner that attracted from the general idea of simplicity
that prevailed in it, while, at the same time, it
displayed to advantage the gracefulness of the wearer.
As a head-dress, a dark veil or mantilla, hanged loosely
from a high and valuable comb, down along the side of
her face over her shoulders, and enhanced by the contrast
her beautiful and clear complexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>Nature in youth, especially when such youth has been
weakened by no unphilosophical propensities, ever inclines
to amendment. In Appadocca, especially, whose
life-time had, up to that period, been spent in the practice
of that strengthening discipline which consists in the
happy combination of exercise for mind and body, it
turned towards health with extraordinary vigour; so that
the stranger, who but a few days ago had been as near
death as mortal man could be, and during whose feverish
paroxysms one would have imagined that the reason
which regulated the form that still writhed in its madness,
was about to take a last farewell of the machinery
which it had up to that time animated and guided, now
presented the clear eye, the earnest look, and the same
stern resolution that usually compressed his lips. The
only remaining indication of the fatigue which he had
undergone, and of the subsequent illness, was the increased
pallor of his complexion, and the slight attenuation of
his body; in a word, it was in body and not in mind
that Appadocca now showed signs of illness.</p>

<p>It was a day or two after this gratifying change had
shown itself, when Appadocca and the beautiful daughter
of the house were seated together in the large apartment
which we have before described.</p>

<p>The stranger was sitting in one of the peculiar but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
luxurious chairs of cow-hide at one side of the wide
window, and Feliciana at the other.</p>

<p>Politeness and gratitude, independently of a sense of
duty, called forth the gallantry of Appadocca in entertaining
the lady. He discoursed on a life in the wilds,
on the marvels that nature can there continually display
to the eyes of the wondering spectator, of the free and
independent life of those who inhabited the “Llanos;”
and from this high and general theme he descended to
the particular beauties that surrounded the romantic
abode of his host himself.</p>

<p>He spoke on. But his greatest and most graceful
eloquence could not draw a word from his beautiful
auditor, or even secure a silent nod. She sat with her
head turned away towards the window, her eyes fixed
on the ground, and wore an air of more than ordinary
seriousness. She seemed entirely wrapped in a web of
her own reflections.</p>

<p>Appadocca could not but remark this reverie. After
having yielded several times to his habit of silence, and
given way to his own abstracted moods, he would awake
himself suddenly, and seeming to feel the embarrassment
of the situation, would address the young lady again
on some new and interesting topic. But it was in
vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“Senora, I hope, is not ill?” he at last inquiringly
observed.</p>

<p>“No, senor,” was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>“Then senora is a little melancholy,” rejoined Appadocca,
after a moment or two.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Banish, senora, that pernicious feeling. Life is
itself sufficiently insipid and sour, and does not require
to be made more bitter by melancholy. Look out, see
how nature softly smiles before you. The birds fly from
branch to branch, and chirp, and are happy; the insects—listen
to the hoarse cicada—seem enjoying their insect
happiness; even the very grass, as the breeze turns its
blades to the beams of the beautiful sun, reflect on our
minds an idea of felicity. How can you be melancholy
when you look out?”</p>

<p>Feliciana turned and bent her large eyes fully on
Appadocca, looked at him intently for a few moments,
and then turned away again.</p>

<p>Struck by the action, and not feeling himself as indifferent
as he usually was, Appadocca said nothing.</p>

<p>A long interval ensued.</p>

<p>Feliciana kept her head in the same direction: at the
side of her eyes two drops began to gather; they grew
larger and larger, and in a few moments stood like two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
crystal beads ready to burst. Not a muscle, however, not
a fibre of the beautiful weeper, seemed to sympathise, or
quiver in unison with this silent grief. Like a statue of
alabaster she remained rooted where she sat,
and one could judge of the emotions which might
affect her, only by the two transparent drops
which balanced heavily at the corners of her
eyes.</p>

<p>Appadocca saw this, and remained silent from respect
to the sorrow of Feliciana. He thought of leaving the
room, and giving the young lady freedom to indulge in
that grief which seemed so deep and overpowering.
Although prompted to do so by his sense of propriety,
still he found himself detained by he knew not what,
and seemed half to suspect that the sorrow had some
sort of connexion with himself,—“Else,” he reasonably
argued, “the young lady would have concealed her
grief in the privacy of her own apartment.”</p>

<p>Appadocca, therefore, remained where he was, in deep
silence, watching the tear drops that now again grew
gradually smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>“Can one who owes, senora, a large amount of gratitude,”
he at last said, in a mild, subdued tone, “be of
any service to her?”</p>

<p>She was still silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Can I do anything to dry these tears?” Appadocca
again inquired.</p>

<p>Feliciana suddenly turned her head, and fixed her
expressive eyes steadily on the inquirer. She maintained
her earnest look for some time, then rising, said,
with great excitement,—</p>

<p>“Yes, you can dry these tears. Shun the wicked
pursuit in which you are engaged, and then these tears
may never again escape to betray me. Nature could
never have intended you for a pirate.”</p>

<p>At this sudden action, and unexpected language of
Feliciana, Appadocca required all his self-command to
conceal the surprise which he felt.</p>

<p>“I a pirate, senora!” he said, “may I ask how it is
you have been induced to suppose me one?”</p>

<p>“Put no idle questions,” she quickly replied, “I feel
that you have sacrificed yourself to such a life. You,
too, have confessed it. Why was it, that in your ravings,
you called on your men to board, to cut down, to
make prisoners? that you spoke of blood, of booty,
and still worse, of revenge; and revenge, too, it would
seem, on your own father? Do you think, to persons
as I am, in my position, the least word of those—of
those—of those—” she contended with herself for the
expression, “those whom we wish well, can fail of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
meaning. I am a stranger to you: but let me not prevail
the less on that account; let me pray and beseech
you, in the name of God and the saints,” she continued,
clasping her hands, “to promise me to abandon a life
that is hateful both to Heaven and earth, and to think
no more of those terrible projects of slaughter and
revenge, about which you spoke so much in your sleep.”</p>

<p>“Pray, senora, sit down,” said Appadocca, as he rose
quickly from his seat to conduct her to hers.</p>

<p>“No, leave me,” she exclaimed, more excited, “I shall
not sit down till you pass your word. Remember the
dear person whose picture you now wear on your heart,
and which you so affectionately pressed to your bosom,
when the fever was on you. Can you suppose that she
can look down from heaven, with joy or pleasure, on the
son that she nourished, when he has abandoned himself
to a course that God and man alike reprobate and condemn?
Picture her in the society of the saints and
angels looking down upon you, at the head of your lawless
and cruel men, red with the blood of your murdered
victims, and rushing forward to plunder, and to spread
misery around as you go. Do you think that the sight
of her child—her son, in this position, can impart to her
either happiness or pleasure? Think of that: and, when
ever you press her picture to your heart, recollect you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
only go through a cheating mockery, that the life you
lead takes away from her happiness, from the happiness
even of heaven. Remember the tears that she may
have shed for you while here: remember the cares and
anxieties she may have suffered for you; those, surely,
were enough: and, if death ended her miseries on earth,
do not you spoil the joy which she may now enjoy in
heaven?”</p>

<p>“Enough—enough,” cried Appadocca, with more
warmth than was his habit, “stop, stop, I implore you.”</p>

<p>“Then promise me.”</p>

<p>“My vow is recorded in heaven, I cannot promise,”
answered Appadocca, drily.</p>

<p>Feliciana staggered stupified to her seat, while she
gazed, without the power of utterance, on the person
before her.</p>

<p>“You will not promise!” she said, recovering herself,
“you will not promise! Well, I shall promise,—I
now vow,—that I shall follow you to the end of the
world, until you consent to renounce for ever this wicked
life.”</p>

<p>So saying, she sprang violently from her chair, and
rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>Appadocca, after the disappearance of the agitated
Feliciana, sank back into the cow-hide chair, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
confounded by the scene which had just been enacted,
and well-nigh distracted by the thousand reflections
which it made to rush upon him. The first thought was
of his safety.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” he quickly reasoned, “others beside Feliciana,
should have heard his disclosures during the fever;
what could he expect under such circumstances, but to
see the kindness with which he had been treated, suddenly
changed into a most ferocious spirit of revenge.”
For he knew, too well, what cruelties the pirates of the
West-Indian sea had, under Llononois and other captains,
practiced on the unfortunate inhabitants of those
coasts.</p>

<p>Those atrocities could not be blotted out from the
memory for centuries, and it was likely, that at the very
name of pirate, the revenge of the Spaniards would
break out as uncontrollably as fire in its favourite
food.</p>

<p>And it was probable, that not stopping to consider
whether he was actually what he was supposed to
be, they would at once immolate him, to the memory of
their slaughtered and plundered countrymen. This
thought, however, soon gave way to those of a different
nature,—to those which in his own manner of thinking,
affected the most important accident of existence, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
was, in his estimation, higher in value than life itself—namely,
his honour.</p>

<p>It had not escaped him from the very moment that
his convalescence had permitted him to exercise his discernment,
that his beautiful and kind nurse, was in love
with him. That could not but strike him; and though
his stoicism balanced violently on the contemplation of
the handsome form, and on appreciating the character of
the mind which was as pure, as simple, and as artless, as
the flourishing wilds which had reared and still surrounded
it, still it required no great restraint over himself—himself,
who had long banished from his heart the sentiment,
that lends to life a charm, and who was now well exercised
in choking to instant death any fresh feeling as it began
to spring—to renounce for ever every desire to encourage
or foster the affection that showed itself to him as clear
as the sun at noonday. It would have been dishonor
to steal away the heart of the innocent creature that
watched over him with a mother’s fondness and anxiety.
He resolved, therefore, to be always on his guard, and
to maintain more than ordinary restraint in conversing
with her, in the hopes that the feeling which evidently
animated her, might perish from the absence of sympathy.</p>

<p>It was, consequently, with alarm that he beheld the violence
of feelings which Feliciana exhibited during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
scene which we have depicted. “No ordinary interest,”
thought Appadocca, “could call forth such an impassioned
remonstrance as Feliciana had made,
and make her surmount all maidenly timidity, and
speak to him as she did. For in what could it interest
a stranger? whether an unhappy man, whom she had
accidently succoured was a pirate or not: and those
tears; persons of her race, he thought, weep only on
deep subjects. And, finally, the desperate resolution of
following him all over the world, professedly to hold
back his hand from crime, was a thought that only one
great feeling could inspire.”</p>

<p>Such were the reflections of Appadocca, they were
made in a moment: and they immediately produced a
resolution as firm as it was sudden. “I must leave the
house of this good Ranchero,” said Appadocca to himself,
with much energy of mind. “God knows, I am already
pledged to the causing of sufficient misery. I shall not
stay here to add any more to the necessary amount.
Not in this place particularly, where I have met with
so much hospitality and kindness.”</p>

<p>These reflections had scarcely been ended, and Appadocca’s
brow was still knit in the energy of his own
thoughts, and his eyes still glimmered forth the fire of
his excited mind, when soft footsteps were heard within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the room, and on turning his head, he beheld Feliciana,
who had again entered the room, and was now advancing
towards him.</p>

<p>She was, by this time, comparatively calm; the
paroxysm of her feeling had passed, but she appeared
still determined on one purpose. Feliciana walked to
the window as she entered, and said to Appadocca, who
stood up to receive her:</p>

<p>“Pray forgive me, sir, for the lengths to which I, a
mere stranger, was bold enough to proceed just now.”</p>

<p>“There needs no forgiveness, senora,” quickly rejoined
Appadocca, as he led her to the other cow-hide chair at
the window, “where no offence has been given: on the
contrary, might I speak so freely, I should say, that the
warmth you have so lately manifested, can be taken
only as the indication of a high degree of feeling.”</p>

<p>Appadocca spoke in a calm and serious strain. The
young lady coloured slightly at the end of this speech.</p>

<p>“Among different persons, senora,” continued Appadocca,
with the apparent purpose of bringing about an
intended end, “it would, perhaps, be a breach of civilized
politeness to speak with the same latitude that I
now intend to do. But, I think as we understand each
other, it would be well nigh folly to keep back a few
necessary words, simply from the circumstance that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
laws of polished social intercourse may tend to render their
plainness awkward. It is very clear, senora, that I have
been fortunate enough to enlist in my favour, your most
friendly sympathy, perhaps I should be justified in mentioning
a much stronger feeling.”</p>

<p>Feliciana coloured deeply.</p>

<p>“For my part, I cannot but express myself sensible
to the existence of such a sentiment, and can only say,
that from a self-same affection, I am capable of appreciating
and responding to yours. But, senora, there are
but few instances of real happiness under the sun. The
beautiful sky that frequently enlivens our spirit, and
cheers us up for a moment, is, alas! but too frequently,
suddenly darkened and obscured by the dark clouds
that bring tempests in their course. The innocent and
snowy lily that gladdens our sight to-day, decays
and falls away to-morrow. The days and years
on which we may have been counting, during a long
life-time, for the realization of a few moments of
joy, may arrive at last, loaded with bitterness.
The thoughts and sentiments which oft gladden us
in our waking dreams, wean us away for a time from
care, and foster in us the hope of undecaying felicity,
then pass like the flashes of the lightning away, to leave
only gloom and desolation behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“For my own part senora, I have long sacrificed myself
to one object. I have long banished away Emmanuel
Appadocca, from Emmanuel Appadocca: it boots not to
tell the reason why. The world to me, it is true, is the
world; the stars, the stars; but the halo that once surrounded
them is gone—the feeling with which I may
have regarded them is gone from them, and has centred
itself in the now single end of my existence. For a
long time mental anguish and I have been companions,
and from its constant proximity it has chased away the
softer feelings, whose aspect is too cheerful to bear the
approaching shadow of that demon. My heart is wasted
and its tenderness gone; gratitude for you, senora, is all
that I dare encourage in my bosom. Let me exhort
you, for your own sake, to forget the unfortunate man
whom accident and distress brought into your presence.
Forget him, and by doing so, avoid much suffering on
your part, and, at the same time, confer much happiness
on him. For if at the hour when this existence of mine
will be about to terminate, there should linger in my
fading memory some object that I could not look upon
with cold indifference; if when the breath of life shall
be on the point of passing I should not be able to shut
my eyes and say, ‘mankind, you have among you
nothing that is dear to me,’ the pains of succumbing
nature would be tenfold heavier than they might.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>In speaking thus, Appadocca had unwittingly to
himself risen from his seat, and approached Feliciana,
who, deeply affected, hanged down her.</p>

<p>Warming more than usual, Appadocca caught her
hand as he spoke.</p>

<p>“To throw away a thought on a person of this temper,
Feliciana,” he proceeded, “I need not tell you, is
doing an injustice to yourself, but fear not that I am
insensible to your kindness. I feel it as much as I am
now permitted to feel such things, and may destiny,”
continued he, with more warmth, “be ever propitious to
you;” so saying, he abruptly let fall her hand, and
walked towards the door.</p>

<p>“Stay,” cried Feliciana, as she rose to keep him back:
but Appadocca rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>The young lady resumed her seat; her high temper
had now yielded to a more tender feeling: one that
buoys not up, nor supports so much, for there is a spirit
of pride in high wrought vexation, that imparts strength
to the other faculties and to the body. Like the last convulsion
of the dying madman, it derives from its very
extremity and excess, uncontrollable strength; but when
that is broken—when it is softened down by tenderness
or pity, the mind which was but now strong under a
fierce influence is left weak, impressible, and like the
vision of a man rising from a swoon, when that influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
is removed. Thus the feelings of Feliciana instead now
of following the course of her stronger and more
predominant powers, yielded entirely to the softer endowments
of her nature, and her affection vented itself
in a more seductive, more natural, more overcoming
way. She no longer endeavoured to disguise to herself
the extent to which her affection had already gone.
She perceived at once that the sorrow which the
involuntary revelations of Appadocca had cost her, had
a different source from that which she would fain have
believed at first; and that her apparently chivalrous
denunciation of his course of life, and her resolution to
follow him, and like a good angel, to stay his piratical
hand, did not spring from a mere instinct of abstract
right and wrong, but rose from a more interesting and
personal feeling.</p>

<p>This great point being laid bare, she at once considered
the circumstances, and the recollection of the
last speech of Appadocca fell upon her heart, like the
chilling hand of death. She sat in silent sorrow, and
the evening had long yielded to night, when her father
returned from the Savannahs to interrupt her grief, and
to divert for a few moments the dark and troubled
currents of her thoughts.</p>

<p>The night was far advanced, when Appadocca undertook
to carry into execution, the design which he had
formed of leaving the Rancha. He cautiously went out
of the apartment which he occupied, and found no
difficulty in opening the carelessly fastened door of the
house. He went out softly, and when he had got outside,
he had to stand still for a moment, in order to
have recourse to his memory to help him to form some
sort of idea of the position in which he found himself:
such was the excessive darkness. Had he previously
petitioned nature for a night, which might effectually
shroud him from any one that might pursue him, she
could not have sent one that was more dark or dismal.
The blackness of the wilds, heightened a thousand-fold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
that of the night, which itself required no augmentation.
Objects seemed heaped together in one pitchy
chaos, and nature seemed to sleep heavily under a
canopy of gloom. The fire flies that flew low and
lonely on the level Savannahs, seemed to show their
light, merely to point out the surrounding darkness.
In the same proportion with this thick gloom was the
silence of the hour, which permitted the faintest sounds
to be heard. At long intervals the brief but sonorous
cry of the owl, as it signaled to its mate, would fall
upon the ear; or there might be heard the hoarse and
unearthly shriek of the night raven, as it vented its rage
at the falling of some fruit, which it carried in its beak;
or, perhaps, the low sound of some tethered and invisible
horse that cropped the short grass hard by.</p>

<p>Incapable of seeing one foot before him, Appadocca
could not proceed. He remembered well where he was,
but the darkness confounded his calculation, and he
knew not in what direction to move.</p>

<p>“The pen lies there,” he said, “no there—no there,”
and vainly pointed where he could not see his own hand
before him.</p>

<p>In this dilemma he bethought him of the stars: full of
hope he quickly looked up: the heavens were as dark
as the earth, not a star was to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I stay where I am,” he inquired of himself,
“until the morning star shows itself? this gloom will
not, it cannot last!” No there might be a chance of
his being discovered, and who knew the inconveniences,
that such a circumstance would bring.</p>

<p>“The wind—there is no wind.”</p>

<p>Appadocca wet the tip of his index finger with his
saliva and turned it round.</p>

<p>“Ha! there is a breath,” he said, as he felt the chill,
on the tip of the moistened finger. “The wind,” he
argued, “blows at this hour in these regions, at a point
varying from north-east to east. Following such a
course, I shall assuredly open on the ocean: good.”</p>

<p>Appadocca now began to move along, keeping his
index finger straight before him, and taking care to
moisten it from time to time. He proceeded under the
pilotage of his sense of feeling, and heard the drowsy
dialogue of some Llaneros, as they lazily turned in their
hammocks, in some neighbouring pen, and asked each
other, if he did not hear some one walking.</p>

<p>The soft breeze still gently blew, and afforded the
same means of directing himself. He tumbled here and
there into the deep farrows which the heavy rains had
made. The severe shocks and bruises which he
received, as he fell into those holes, were quite sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
to try the endurance of a strong man, much less that of
one who was but just recovering from illness. Fortunately
the point to be attained was not far off, and
Appadocca, after having groped his way for an hour,
heard the low moaning of the ocean before him. He
approached as much as he thought he could with prudence,
for he conjectured that the ground would be the
more broken and torn, as it verged nearer toward the
sea; and, finally, sat down on the grass to await the
approach of morning.</p>

<p>The gray light which temporarily chases away darkness
immediately before the advent of morning, to leave
a moment afterward the gloom which it dispelled for a
time, came. Careful not to lose one favourable moment,
Appadocca immediately got up, and advanced in the
direction in which the sea was rolling. Again, however,
he was obliged to suspend his progress, for darkness
again returned.</p>

<p>At the approach of the real light Appadocca felt his
sensibility deeply moved by the view which opened
before him. The great Atlantic rolled heavily below,
and it was only where the horizon limited vision that its
silently rising mountains would appear as if they were
at last levelled into easy quietness. Its moving volumes
were as yet undisturbed by the wind, and the transparent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
haze that still floated over its surface, imparted an
air of repose that well befitted the hour. The mountain-peaks
of the little islands that lined the shore, rose
forth to contrast the wild waste of waters, and then
came the high land on which he stood, that verged to
the north-west into capacious bays and havens, and
pointed out towards the east, and advanced high and
lofty like a battalion of fearless soldiers, against the
billows that lashed them, and that had likely lashed them
long long before they bore the adventurous Columbus
to its foot. At his back, also, lay the level and wide-spreading
Savannahs, where, too, only the horizon
bourned the sight.</p>

<p>Solitary and alone in such a situation, Appadocca
could not refuse to his heart the pleasure of admiring
such a scene; and, although prudence, not to say safety,
pressed him to hie away from the Rancha, he could not
resist the temptation of resting and feasting his eyes
upon that which was before and around him.</p>

<p>Rousing himself, however, from the influence of this
feeling, he endeavoured, and succeeded in descending
the cliffs, and resolved to wait until fortune, or, to
use his own expression, destiny, should send in his
way, one of the numerous little vessels that trade
along that coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>That day passed, and destiny—the broken reed—was
not kind enough to send a vessel his way. Worn out
with anxiety, and weakened by the want of food, he
drew himself up in the chasm of a rock, with the intention
of resting himself there in the best way that his
unbroken fast, and the uninviting accommodation would
permit.</p>

<p>Despite these two unfavourable circumstances, he fell
into a deep sleep, and had been under its influences for
some hours, when he was startled by a most terrifying
noise. It seemed that numbers of savage animals were
assembled immediately above his head, and were designedly
giving vent in one unbroken roar to their dismal
and fearful howlings, that rose above the measured breakings
of the billows below.</p>

<p>“What can this be,” said Appadocca to himself, as he
awoke; “what now comes to break this slumber that
weans me from the sense of hunger?” So saying, he
jumped up and walked a little way from the foot of the
cave, across the beach, and looked up. He perceived
the dark outlines of some large animals, that were moving
about restlessly on the ridge, and were howling in the
manner we have described.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he exclaimed, “shall I have escaped from
the scaffold, the waves of the Atlantic ocean, and from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the jaws of the sharks that fill the bocas, to be, at last,
ignominiously devoured by wild beasts; by Heaven,
then, whatsoever you be, if you attack me, I warn you,
you will attack one that is prepared for you, and one
who is ready, at this moment, to make any one, or any
thing, bear a heavy amount of chastisement.”</p>

<p>This was spoken in a resolute and even fierce and
over-confident tone. The speaker seemed impatient.</p>

<p>There has not been, perhaps, a single philosopher
since the human race began, to ruminate on rules and
plans of human excellence, who can be said to have entirely
controlled the emotion of anger. All our other
feelings seem to give way, and yield to the discipline of a
well-watched life, and to the strong volition of our
reason, but that passion alone still remains uncontrollable;
smothered it may be for a time, it is true, but it is liable
on the very first occasion, to be fiercely kindled. It
seems to be so intimately connected, although negatively
with the pleasures of the mind and body, and consequently
with the gratification of the actual cultivation
of philosophy itself, that any derangement of any of these
things acts in producing the feeling which human perfection
is too weak to avoid.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his cynicism, Appadocca was irritated
by the numberless difficulties that fell to his lot to surmount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>‘But a feather breaks the loaded camel’s back’: he had
undergone privations, borne sufferings, staked life, happiness—all
that was dear and solacing to man—on the
accomplishment of a design; after exerting himself to an
extent that such as he, only, could exert themselves; after
sacrificing the happiness that a lovely and angelic being
was willing to confer, he was, at the eleventh hour, of his
suffering, when hope began to beam again, now exposed
to be devoured by vile unreasonable creatures.</p>

<p>These reflections might have been made on another
occasion, without endangering the temper of the person
who made them. But Appadocca was now almost maddened
by fatigue and hunger. Famine makes the most
steady violent, and human nature has already a sufficiently
hard duty to contain itself, even when starvation
is not present to gall it into rage.</p>

<p>In this mood he stood boldly on the shore, looking up
at the wild beasts, with his chest heaving highly and
quickly, and apparently desiring that they should rush
upon him at once, and afford a but to his fury, and put
an end to his unsweetened existence. His wishes were
partly fulfilled.</p>

<p>The animals rushed to and fro and seemed to be
looking for a footing to descend the crag; but their
instinct apparently did not deem it sufficiently secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
for that purpose, for they drew back and howled as if
disappointed of their prey.</p>

<p>“Fools,” cried Appadocca, addressing them with
more rage than reason, “go further down the ridge if
you would have me to feast upon.”</p>

<p>One of the animals, bolder than the others, went
as far forward as possible, and seemed to have
found a means of descending, but as the creature
endeavoured to rest the weight of its body on the
projection, on which it had laid one of its paws,
it gave way. Its balance was lost and headlong it
tumbled down the precipice. It had no sooner reached
the ground, than Appadocca, wild as the animals themselves,
threw himself upon it and buried his thumb and
finger into its neck.</p>

<p>“Now you must either kill me, or I shall kill you,
vile creature that assails me, as if mankind could not
inflict sufficient injury without your coming from your
native wilds and forests to aid them. Die, by Heaven!
or I shall”—saying this, he contracted his muscles as
tightly as the sinews of a convulsive man.</p>

<p>The animal lay for awhile stunned by the fall; but as
soon as the blood commenced to circulate again, it
felt the pressure on its wind-pipe, and began to kick
violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Kick your spirit away, vile brute, I shall not budge,”
cried Appadocca, now half mad with fury.</p>

<p>On its legs the creature stood, and shook its head and
plunged, and away it went with Appadocca still clutching
its wind-pipe with the grasp of the dying crocodile.
The animal staggered a few paces and fell heavily to the
ground, strangled to death.</p>

<p>Appadocca got up from the ground to which he had
been borne by the beast in its fall, and walked round his
prey in triumph.</p>

<p>“Whatever you are,” said he, “provided you are flesh
and blood, I shall have a meal of you.”</p>

<p>He groped about among the small stones that strewed
the upper part of the beach, and found what he seemed
to have been searching for, a flint. He dashed it
against a larger one and with the sharp pieces of it he
began to cut through the hide of the animal that he had
killed. He then succeeded in cutting a large portion of
the still quivering flesh, and eat it.</p>

<p>What will not famine relish? Oh! hunger, that
eternally tells us of our lowliness. Hunger levels. Hunger
brings down the highest and proudest individuals to the
standard of the meanest creature, whose instinct is to
eat, whose life is concentrated in devouring, and whose
death comes by over-feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>After Appadocca had fed upon the reeking flesh of
his victim, he seemed recalled to himself: the madness
of famine was past. He now looked upon the carcass
before him with the indifference that formed the greater
part of his nature, and the faint glimmerings of the fact
that he had defied that beast which was now before him,
and had engaged it in mortal combat, disgusted him:
he contemned himself, too, when he recollected a little,
the vain boastful and undignified language that he had
held, and bent his steps in much sadness towards the
same crevice where he had slept away the first part of
the night. The other animals had fled after the fall of
the one we have mentioned, and the stillness of the
night was, as before, broken upon only by the moans of
the ocean.</p>

<p>The next morning revealed to Appadocca the extent
of the danger that he had escaped the night before.
The animal was discovered to be one of those American
tigers or jaguars, which pervade the plains of South
America, and whose hunger has not unfrequently surmounted
their instinctive cowardice so far as to bring
them to the very houses of the Rancheros. The huge
and powerful jaws of the animal, in which his bones
could have been ground to pieces, attracted the attention
of Appadocca; and when he observed the wound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
on the animal—the rude incision that he had made with
the flint, and recollected the bloody meal that he had
made of its flesh, he shuddered in disgust.</p>

<p>It was now that, withdrawing his eyes from the
jaguar, he perceived at a distance a small craft tossing
about on the heavy billows. He nimbly climbed the
eminence to have a better view of what he feared his
fancy may have too flatteringly pictured to him. It
was in reality a small <i>fallucha</i> that was labouring on the
heavy seas. Her course was under the land, but on the
reach she was edging sea-ward. Alarmed at this appearance,
he came down the cliff and ran along the beach
towards the little vessel. Having got nearly opposite,
he halloed as loudly as he could. He was not heard;
again he cried, but with as little success as before.</p>

<p>“Am I destined again to meet with other misfortunes?”
he muttered, calmly. “Am I destined to be
left to perish on this unfrequented shore! Oh my
father! how many events seem to arise to befriend you.
Were I not sufficiently grounded in my belief, I would
be almost tempted to believe that destiny, or Providence,
or something else, exerted itself to shield you from your
merited chastisement. But avaunt, vain, and stupid
thought, the fatalities that have befallen thee, Emmanuel
Appadocca, are only the acting of one of the grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
laws by which yon sun stands where it is, while the
earth wheels around it; or by which thou thyself
throttled the huge beast last night. Dost thou not see
that the distance is too far for thy voice to reach?
Providence has instruments enough among his creatures,
he does not interfere with our little concerns.”</p>

<p>Muttering this, Appadocca climbed the heights, took
off the jacket with which the hospitable Ranchero had
provided him, and waved it in the air.</p>

<p>The mariners on board the <i>fallucha</i> held their oars in
mid-air.</p>

<p>“They have seen me,” said Appadocca, and waved
the jacket again.</p>

<p>The <i>fallucha</i> had discovered the signal.</p>

<p>Casting away the jacket, Appadocca threw himself
at once from an overhanging rock into the sea, and
began to swim boldly out to meet the vessel that was
now slowly approaching him.</p>

<p>His eagerness however, was now well nigh proving
his death; for miscalculating the distance as well as his
strength, he had ventured farther than his fatigues
could justify. He was just sinking from exhaustion,
when the powerful arm of a sailor from on board the
<i>fallucha</i> grasped him.</p>

<p>He was laid on one of the rower’s benches, where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
lay insensible. The sailors gravely bent over him, and
tried every means for producing re-animation, which
was not easily attained, for the Spaniards had no effectual
restoratives, and Appadocca was now so overwhelmed,
that the healthy elasticity of nature was almost destroyed.</p>

<p>Appadocca proffered his thanks to the four men who
formed the crew of that little vessel for their kindness,
as soon as he had come to himself.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the captain, after receiving
the thanks, “and where do you come from, you do not
seem to me to be a seaman?”</p>

<p>“No,” readily answered Appadocca, “I went out
from Trinidad in my pleasure boat, together with some
friends; we were taken through the bocas by the force
of the currents, and having inadvertently approached too
near a whirlpool, we were capsized. My friends have
been drowned. I am the only one who have survived:
I managed to swim ashore, and had to encounter a
number of accidents, and a large amount of suffering.
I at last saw your vessel.”</p>

<p>“And where are you going,” he demanded in his
turn, anxious to divert further inquiry.</p>

<p>“To Trinidad.”</p>

<p>“To which port,” again demanded Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“To any one where I may be able to sell my cargo,”
answered the captain of the <i>fallucha</i>.</p>

<p>Appadocca yielded himself up to his reflections.</p>

<p>The captain could not withdraw his eyes from the
stranger. He looked at him with the peculiar expression
of the face, which indicates the absence of entire
mental satisfaction, with regard to the reality of the object
gazed upon. Still there was nothing in the appearance
of Appadocca that could warrant any definite suspicion;
but there was a combination in it, nevertheless, which
forcibly attracted attention, and inspired a peculiar sort
of feeling that probably was akin to awe.</p>

<p>The morning gradually passed. When the strong
trade-wind sprang about eleven o’clock, the rowers
pulled in their sweeps; the feather-like sails of the
<i>fallucha</i> were hoisted; her head was pointed towards
the bocas, and the little vessel began to mount over
the waves under her closely boarded sheets. The
sailors now carelessly threw themselves at full length
on the rowers’ benches; the captain kept his eye on
the bows of the little vessel; and Appadocca gazed pensively
on the ocean before him. Had any of those who
were on board the <i>fallucha</i> cast his eyes towards the
land that lay on the lee, he would probably have made
out the dim outlines of a female form that was waving
a white handkerchief in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>At night-fall, the <i>fallucha</i> was in the chops of the
outlets.</p>

<p>Appadocca thus saw himself, by a strange coincidence,
in the same place and about the same time that he
had jumped from the man-of-war. He gazed on the
rolling waves which nature had surrounded with the
terrors both of the animated and unanimated portions
of creation. For the rocks beneath the impending
mountains, together with the waves that looked merciless
and unrelenting, raised at first sight the idea of
sure destruction: while the huge repulsive sharks that
are there to be seen in thousands reminded one of a
still more painful and frightful death.</p>

<p>“Nil arduum,” muttered Appadocca, as he gazed on
the scene of his daring adventure, “said the Roman
poet, and no mortal ever enunciated a greater truth.
Here are these overwhelming waves that seem to
carry sure destruction on their frowning crest, that
roll over an abyss, which if it were dry, would be difficult
for man to fathom, that contain within themselves
all sorts of huge and destructive monsters, in comparison
to the smallest fins of which, man, enterprizing,
achieving man, dwindles to the insignificance of the rose-twig
by the side of the towering magnolia: still the
human race subjugates them even in their fiercest mood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
and from their frail fabric of boards and pitch, men make
war on their dangerous denizens. Not only that, but I, my
very self, at the hour of midnight, when man and beast
retire to their habitations, and sleep away darkness and its
horrors, I plunged into the terrific waters with only a
clay-pot to help me through, and here I am, principally
by dint of perseverance, safe and sound. Oh, human
race, you know not your power; you know not what you
could do if you would only throw away the superstitious
fears in which you have enthralled yourselves, and venture
to assume a position, which the indefiniteness of your intellect
assuredly intends you for. But you must study
the law of nature: until you do that, you cannot be fit
to achieve great things; as you are, you are living merely
like brutes, with this aggravation, that the resources
of your reason give you a greater facility of corrupting
yourselves, and of becoming cowardly and base, the
natural effect of corruption.</p>

<p>“Had I permitted myself,” continued Appadocca, “to
be nursed in the lap of an enervating luxury, either
mental or bodily, to be surrounded with numbers of base
menials, whose care was to prevent even the dew of
heaven from falling too heavily upon me, who were to
prepare the couches of indolence for me, who were to
pamper my body, beyond the power of endurance, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
at last transform me into an animal lacking thews and
muscles? if I had been tutored to look upon the falling
of a picture as a calamity, or been taught to tremble at
the ramblings of a mouse; and more, had I permitted
my mind to be enslaved by the ignorant notions of fiends,
of horrors after death, and of all those things by which
the world is made to quake in utter fear, should I have
undertaken the execution of a design that would have
been made to appear, even more terrible than that death
in which its entire failure could have resulted? No,
decidedly not.</p>

<p>“And, my good father,” a sardonic smile might have
been marked about his lips, “rejoice while you can, amidst
vain pomps and ceremonies, surrounded as you are again
by smiling and sympathising sycophants, for your time
of merry-making will be but short.”</p>

<p>Such were the half-muttered reflections of Appadocca
as the <i>fallucha</i> crossed the bocas.</p>

<p>Having once cleared the straits, the little vessel drew
closely under the land on the left side with her sails
filled by the cool and gentle land breeze. She was sailing
up to Port-of-Spain, among the beautiful little islands
with which the reader was made acquainted at the
beginning of this narrative. The curling wavelets of
the smooth gulf broke on the sharp prow of the fast-sailing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
<i>fallucha</i>, and kept up a soothing music that invited
to repose. The rustling of the trees that grew to the
water’s edge, charmed the ear of the mariner; the land
breeze wafted far out to sea the sweet perfumes of the
wild flowers, which nature has known to create only in
the tropics.</p>

<p>The little vessel was doubling a small promontory,
and entering the beautiful bay which indents the coast
about that part, and is known as “Chaguaradmas
Bay,” when the hasty splashes of several oars were suddenly
heard, while, from the darkness of the night, the
approaching boat was still unseen.</p>

<p>The splashes every moment grew more and more loud
and distinct, they sounded more and more near, and
suddenly a large boat, pulled by ten armed men,
appeared, and the next instant the <i>fallucha</i> was boarded;
as nimbly as antelopes the men jumped into the little
craft.</p>

<p>“Que es ese?” the Spaniards simultaneously cried,
and each drew his knife.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” exclaimed Appadocca, with more warmth
than his cynicism could justify, and, in a moment, that
officer—for it was he—was affectionately shaking his
chief by the hand: they were both much affected.</p>

<p>How sweet it is when loving relatives have died away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
one by one, when lover has been inconstant, and has
shot the arrow—coldness—through the loving heart;
when the ingratitude of professed friends has frozen the
limpid currents of our feelings, when the world has
heaped upon us miseries on miseries, and then has cast
us forth; when father shews the front of enmity to filial
deservedness, when we are isolated in ourselves in this
great world of numbers of movements and of alacrity;
how sweet it is to meet, after separation, the friend
whose heart-strings throb in sympathy with ours, and
about whose head the shadows of suspicion could never play.</p>

<p>At the sound of the captain’s well-known voice, a
loud and prolonged cheer from the men in the boat,
echoed in the silence of the night far and wide over the
gulf, and was repeated long and loudly by the ringing
dales on the shore.</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks,” exclaimed Lorenzo, in his joy, “to
the chance that sent us after this vessel.”</p>

<p>“Where is the schooner?” inquired Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Behind that promontory, that you barely see: she
is there safely hidden.”</p>

<p>“Then take the helm,” said Appadocca, “and steer
to her.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo attempted to take the tiller out of the hands
of the captain, but met with strong resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>The captain of the <i>fallucha</i> brandished his knife, and
called on his men to assist.</p>

<p>“Stop,” coolly said Appadocca, “do not resist: I
shall give you five hundred dollars for your little vessel
and its cargo. Submit, I am Appadocca, the young
pirate.”</p>

<p>“Jesu!” cried the captain of the <i>fallucha</i>, “whom
did I receive on board my vessel?” and he resignedly
gave up the tiller.</p>

<p>The command of the <i>fallucha</i> was now taken by the
pirate party. She was immediately put about. On
making two or three tacks she headed the small promontory,
and discovered the long Black Schooner that
lay enshrouded, in the silence of night, on the smooth
and deepening bay.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After Lorenzo had been satisfactorily informed, by
the confessions of the midshipman, with regard to the
safety of his chief, deeming it no longer necessary
to hazard any nearer approach to the man-of-war,
he kept the schooner where she was: while, at the same,
he continued to keep the ship-of-war still within sight.
He was enabled to do so by an instrument of a very
peculiar and strange device. From the tall masts of the
schooner, there were reared to an immense height into
the air long poles of steel that were joined and joined
again to each other, and were, at the same time, carefully
secured on all sides; at the top of these were
adjusted large globe-shaped metallic mirrors, that were
filled with a thick white liquid, which was continuously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
agitated by a small electric engine, which received its
power from a battery on deck. These mirrors, when
the sun was at a certain height, were made, by a trigonometrical
principle, to receive impressions of objects
that were beyond the scope of the human eye, and by
conveying those impressions to other mirrors, that were
fixed in a thousand different ways, to the several parts
of the vessel, gave the power to an individual on deck
to see every movement of any vessel which would
otherwise be invisible, while his own remained unseen.</p>

<p>Thus, by the force of the same genius with which he might
have shone among men on the side of good, Appadocca
was enabled to excel, to be unapproachable and irresistible
in his career of crime and evil. The firmness of mind
which enabled him to curb the natures of even pirates,
and to establish a discipline on board the Black Schooner
that made his men simultaneously act as if they were
but the individual members of only one single body
moved but by one spirit, might, perhaps, have procured
for him the reputation of a wise and great leader; the
powers of invention, which supplied even the deficiencies
of human nature, and permitted him to make almost
every element his servant, could again have handed
down his name to posterity as that of a profound philosopher,
if his talents had been turned to a proper object.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
But the combination of circumstances—destiny, decided
otherwise, and instead of finding himself in the high
position of good, Appadocca found himself, by the very
necessity of those self-same talents, in the high position
of evil.</p>

<p>It is not Emmanuel Appadocca alone that has been
thus doomed to bury a high intellect in obscurity, or been
impelled by circumstances to expend its force in guilt.
No: the world seems scarcely as yet prepared for genius,
a higher humanity is required and must exist, before the
man who possesses it can find a congenial place of existence
on this planet. Mere chance now moves the
balance in which he is weighed; circumstances either
hazardously call him forth, or he is left to feed upon his
own disgust, until his rough sands are run, then earth
covers over the fire that ought to burn only in the skies.
From among one hundred men of genius scarcely
one ever goes beyond the boundary of the desert
on which so many flowers are destined to “blush
unseen.”</p>

<p>It was two hours after noon, on the day which we
have above mentioned, that Lorenzo was standing by
the helmsman of the schooner, eagerly reading the
reflections of the mirrors, when the signals of Appadocca
from the man-of-war fell upon his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“What is this?” involuntarily exclaimed the officer,
as he read the well-known symbols of his chief.</p>

<p>“Too late, too late! his stupidity has already made
him undergo the torture,” he exclaimed, as he deciphered,—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Treat well the officer, for they treat me
well.—SCORPION.</span>”</p>

<p>Lorenzo gave an order to the officer on duty; a
piercing sound was then heard; in a moment or two,
the sides of the schooner became peopled with men,
whose brawny arms were bared up to the shoulders.
Not a word was spoken. The polished and shining
guns of the schooner were immediately pointed, they
seemed to thrust their muzzles through the port-holes,
as if they worked by one impulse, by their own choice
and their own action, for the slightest difference could
not be traced either in the time or in the manner in
which each separate piece was moved to its proper
place.</p>

<p>Another piercing sound: each gun was fired at the
precise moment. The schooner shook under the deafening
explosion that followed, and the ocean rang, and
rang again with the echo.</p>

<p>This was Lorenzo’s reply to the request of Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>By the aid of the same machine, that officer perceived
when the man-of-war set all her sails, and began her
voyage to Trinidad, as he concluded, both from the
revelation of the young officer, and the direction in
which she was steering. He rejoiced when he observed
this, for he was persuaded that, in the event of the man-of-war
entering the Gulf of Paria, he would be able
triumphantly to rescue his chief. For the thousand
bays and creeks which diversify the shore, the distance
at which large vessels are obliged to remain on account
of the harbour’s shallowness, and the lukewarmness of
the inhabitants of the town with regard to pirates, for
they have seldom or never been subjected to the ravages
of those people, he calculated, would afford him all
assistance, while they should, on the contrary, tend to
perplex, hinder, and embarrass the enemy.</p>

<p>He immediately ordered a certain quantity of sails to
be put on the schooner, and began to follow the man-of-war.
He kept always out of sight, and at noon on each
day, the sails were lowered, the same machine was erected,
and he made his observations on the ship-of-war, which
sailed away majestically, its commander little knowing
that he was followed by a cunning, vigilant, and determined
enemy.</p>

<p>Four hours had not elapsed since the man-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
had crossed the bocas, before the Black Schooner also
passed them, and thus left in the water behind her the
person to whose rescue she was going.</p>

<p>Lorenzo kept her head still towards the centre of the
gulf, then went about, and, with one tack, gained the
headland, behind which the schooner now lay concealed.</p>

<p>In that position, Lorenzo quickly disguised himself,
and taking possession of one of the many little vessels
that sail along the shore from the Spanish main, went
up to Port-of-Spain, and heard the confused intelligence
that Appadocca had committed suicide.</p>

<p>His cargo was sold, and he could remain no longer in
the harbour for fear of detection, so he resolved upon
the plan of taking another <i>fallucha</i>, and of returning to
Port-of-Spain as a different captain. He lay in watch
for the first vessel which might pass, and destiny willed
that the one which he should board should carry Appadocca.</p>

<p class="tb">As soon as Appadocca had arrived on board of the
schooner, after having bowed to the officer and men, who
saluted him, he descended the companion-steps and
requested Lorenzo to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>They arrived at the Captain’s cabin: and Jack
Jimmy, who met Appadocca at the door, stood on tiptoe,
threw his head forward, opened his eyes, and was
just on the point of venting some exclamation, when
Appadocca made a sign to him to be silent. The little
man, almost bursting with the internal ebullition of the
greeting which he was obliged to restrain, retreated into
an angle, and Appadocca passed on.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said he to Lorenzo, when they had
arrived into the cabin, “and allow me to express my
approval of the brave and wise manner in which you
have discharged your duty during my absence.”</p>

<p>The officer bowed modestly.</p>

<p>“Has the crew always acted up to its office?” Appadocca
demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, your excellency,” replied Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“The unfortunate accident,” proceeded Appadocca,
“which happened, deprived us of our last booty: but,
in two days’ time I shall let the men have as much as
they can desire. I shall let them have pleasure to-morrow.
Lorenzo, let us drink together.”</p>

<p>Appadocca pressed a spring, and one of his attendants
appeared and laid on a table wine and drinking-cups.
Appadocca filled a goblet and passed the
decanter to Lorenzo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks to you, Lorenzo,” said Appadocca, and
drank.</p>

<p>“To the joy of your return, your excellency,” said
Lorenzo, and did the same.</p>

<p>In a few moments after the officer left the cabin.</p>

</div>

<p>At early dawn on the morning that followed the
departure of Appadocca, Feliciana was sitting in the
principal apartment of the Rancha. She was occupying
her favourite chair by the window, and with her cheek
resting upon her hand, was gazing listlessly and absently
on the green grass without, on which the dew still
sparkled in the silvery rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p>She seemed occupied by her own thoughts, although
the beautiful picture of waking nature—a scene always
enchanting in the tropics—was before her, and every
moment, as she heard the rustling of the <i>carat</i> that
roofed the house, or the creaking of the cedar windows
as they became heated with the sun, or any other sound
which might resemble a footfall, she turned her head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
eagerly to look, and turned away again, evidently disappointed
when she saw nothing.</p>

<p>The morning merged more and more towards noon,
she more and more frequently turned round to look, but
seemed every time disappointed as before, for Appadocca,
whom she was expecting, did not appear.</p>

<p>“Can he be ill,” thought Feliciana, “Maria, Maria!”
she cried, as she became more and more alarmed by the
idea.</p>

<p>An old servant appeared, and was immediately
sent to see if the stranger was well.</p>

<p>She soon returned, and said that there was no one in
the room.</p>

<p>Feliciana jumped up and rushed into the apartment
which Appadocca had occupied. No one had
slept on the bed.</p>

<p>The truth now broke in upon the young lady. Her
countenance fell; she walked back dejectedly to her
chair, and looked out as before.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” asked the old domestic, who had
now a long time waited in vain for the orders of her
absent mistress.</p>

<p>Feliciana started: “Tell my papa,” she said, and
turned away her head.</p>

<p>The old domestic went slowly and in a side-long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
manner out of the apartment, gazing at the young lady
the whole time, and muttering “what is the matter
with the child?”</p>

<p>Feliciana remained where she was the greater part of
the day, closed her ears to the repeated exhortations of
her old servant to take food, and declared, in answer
to her pressing questions, that she had had a disagreeable
dream the night before, which had thrown a feeling
of melancholy over her the whole of that day.
When she retired to her apartment in the evening, the
young lady hastily gathered her valuables, and wrote
a letter, which she addressed to her father, and sat
quietly and pensively until the night was half spent.
She then rose, and carefully let herself out of the house,
and walked slowly and cautiously away, until she got to
a considerable distance from the Rancha. Once in the
open field, the bold Feliciana began to run, for it was
only by running that she could keep pace with the rapidity
and activity of her thoughts. The next day she was by the
sea shore, and was just in time to catch a glimpse
of the little <i>fallucha</i> which had received Appadocca on
board, as she was sailing away. She waved her handkerchief,
but no one on board saw her, and the <i>fallucha</i> left
her behind.</p>

<p>Undaunted by this accident, the young lady continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
her journey along the shore, moving, however,
in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>Oppressed with fatigue, she sat for a moment, in the
evening, on the grass, to rest herself.</p>

<p>The dull sounds of horses’ hoofs in a short time were
distinctly heard.</p>

<p>“I am undone,” Feliciana exclaimed, and turned to
look.</p>

<p>Two horsemen were seen rapidly approaching in the
direction by which she herself had come.</p>

<p>“They are my father’s men,” she said to herself, and
looked about for some tree, or other object, behind
which she might conceal herself: but there was not a
thing at hand.</p>

<p>The horsemen drew closer and closer again; she
looked round once more: at a short distance, the grass
seemed to grow richer and thicker. She crept along
towards this point, and threw herself flat into the tuft:
but she was barely concealed, and durst not hope to
escape being seen.</p>

<p>“I cannot avoid being taken,” she said to herself, and
seemed unnerved by the thought. The horsemen approached
nearer and nearer. The thoughts of Appadocca
crowded on her; the conflict of undefined feelings
which had taken place in her mind, had ended in leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
her a being that was devoted to that mysterious man,
and one who could now form no idea of life in which he
was not the beginning and the end. Her fears now
yielded to a stronger feeling; she drew from her bosom
a gilded poniard, and vowed that she would not be deterred
from fulfilling her vow as long as she lived. The
horsemen had almost arrived to where she was, they
came opposite to her, they looked neither on one side
nor on the other, but seemed entirely absorbed by the
subject on which they were conversing in a loud tone of
voice.</p>

<p>From her hiding place Feliciana could see them
distinctly. Joy, joy! they were not her father’s men.
But may they not be other persons that were sent after
her in one direction, while her father’s own Llaneros
went in another? She remained quiet and listened.</p>

<p>“No, I shall not take less than seven piastres each for
my oxen; and, as for my jack-asses, I shall not let them
go for less than four piastres a-head,” said one of the
horsemen.</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” replied the other; “those
people in Trinidad can afford to pay a good price for
their bullocks. By-the-bye, have you remarked what
a number more of beasts we sell since the English took
that island. I understand these fellows live entirely on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
beef, and that is the reason why they are such good
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Good or bad soldiers,” answered the other, “if they
eat beef, and make us sell our cattle, that is all we care
about.”</p>

<p>“They are merchants,” said Feliciana to herself, and
resolved at once to speak to them.</p>

<p>“Yes, continued the first speaker, I shall not—”</p>

<p>“Ho!” cried Feliciana, springing from the ground,
“senores, senores, ho!”</p>

<p>The horsemen looked round, and crossed themselves,
and at the same time, cried, “Jesu!”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop, I wish to speak to you,” Feliciana continued.</p>

<p>The horseman reined up their horses, and remained
apparently under the effect of some powerful fear.</p>

<p>“What may she be?”</p>

<p>“Who knows what she may be! that’s just the reason
why we should obey her,” replied the other.</p>

<p>In the mean time Feliciana came up.</p>

<p>“Shall we speak to her?” one inquired of the other.</p>

<p>“Where are you riding to, senores?” she inquired.</p>

<p>They looked inquiringly at each other, and then
asked each other in a whisper, “Shall I answer?”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to, senores?” she repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“To Guiria, beautiful lady,” one at last answered.</p>

<p>“Be good enough to take me with you,” said Feliciana.</p>

<p>The horsemen looked amazed at each other.</p>

<p>“I shall give you two hundred piastres.”</p>

<p>The two horsemen opened their eyes.</p>

<p>“Two hundred piastres?” they repeated inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And who are you, beautiful lady, that are thus
solitary in the Savannahs? are you one of us or some
blessed spirit that is permitted to walk the earth. We
are good and true catholics, do not harm us, we beseech
you.” The two horsemen here devoutly crossed themselves
respectively.</p>

<p>“I am no spirit,” answered Feliciana, “but an unfortunate
lady, who is flying to the rescue of—of—her—husband:
pray take me on with you, and I shall
reward you, as I have said.”</p>

<p>The horsemen mused, and whispered to each other
for a moment. Then one of them dismounted.</p>

<p>“Senora,” he said, “Heaven forbid that we should
ever commit the crime of leaving a lady in the wilds
without shelter or protection. Allow me to assist you
in mounting my horse.”</p>

<p>Feliciana was supported on the saddle. The three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
persons then proceeded on their journey. The horsemen
changed places alternately at the various stages of the
journey; and while one walked at the side of Feliciana’s
horse, the other rode by turns, until they arrived in the
environs of the town of Guiria, where Feliciana found
a number of opportunities to continue her wanderings
in search of Appadocca.</p>

<p>After Appadocca had jumped overboard, the large
ship passed the bocas safely, entered upon the still
waters of the gulf, and within a few hours afterwards
her large Anchor was cast off the harbour of Port-of-Spain.</p>

<p>As the vessel approached nearer to her port of destruction,
Charles Hamilton had become more and
more anxious, and uneasy about the fated doom which
he saw every moment hanging lower and lower over his
friend. He reasonably argued that, with such a willing
witness as James Willmington, and with such a stoical
disposition as his friend had formed to himself, there would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
not be the slightest chance of Appadocca’s acquittal when
he should be tried. For Willmington, it was to be
supposed, would not attenuate the least feature of the
case, nor would Appadocca descend from his high
notions of philosophy to conceal or deny the charges
that would be brought against him.</p>

<p>In this state of mind, Charles Hamilton considered
a long time, and endeavoured to think of some means
of still saving his friend. It was, however, a difficult
and perplexing matter, for the only available measures
that he could adopt, were doggedly repudiated by
Appadocca himself.</p>

<p>“Confound his obstinacy,” the young officer muttered,
when he thought of his friend’s infatuation; “he might
have been saved long ago if it were not for that.”</p>

<p>Among a number of expedients and plans, Hamilton
at last adopted the one of having an interview with
James Willmington, of endeavouring to soften down
his persecuting feeling, and of establishing, if not terms
of kindness and affection, at least those neutrality and
indifference between him and Appadocca.</p>

<p>It was in this disposition, that long before the sun
had risen on the morning after the man-of-war had come
to an anchor, Charles Hamilton requested a servant to
ask James Willmington to be good enough to attend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
him in his cabin. Willmington, whose excitement had
kept him awake the whole night, shortly appeared.</p>

<p>“Be good enough to sit down, sir,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>Willmington sat down.</p>

<p>“I have taken the liberty, sir, of asking you to my
cabin, to speak to you on a subject that I am aware
must be very delicate; but my great anxiety for my
friend, and the just apprehension that I entertain with
regard to his life itself, have led me to put aside whatever
reluctance I should otherwise feel, and to speak to
you on that head.”</p>

<p>Willmington looked stolidly and vaguely at Hamilton,
and said not a word.</p>

<p>“You are aware, sir,” continued Hamilton, “that
Appadocca runs, at this moment, the risk of his life.”</p>

<p>“I am aware, sir,” replied Willmington, briefly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, shutting my eyes to all family quarrels—”</p>

<p>“There are no quarrels in my family that I know of,
sir,” interrupted Willmington.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will hear me out,” remarked Hamilton.</p>

<p>Willmington exhibited the rudiments of a bow.</p>

<p>“Shutting my eyes to all private quarrels between
you, I say, I cannot but consider it a misfortune that
a young man, like Appadocca, should be brought to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
disgraceful death on a scaffold at such an early age.
You will be the only prosecutor in this case, and, to a
certain extent, you hold his life in your hands; will you
suspend—suspend your animosity, and give Appadocca
a chance of escape?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, sir,” said Willmington.</p>

<p>“I do not think there is much obscurity about what
I said,” remarked Hamilton, in his turn.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, sir, to ask me to connive at a felony,
and to permit a criminal to escape?”</p>

<p>“Call it what you choose, sir; I ask you to save
Appadocca from an ignoble and untimely death,”
answered Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I must tell you at once, I cannot. The
law must take its course. Beside, sir, I feel called
upon by public justice and morality, to bring to punishment
the individual in whose favour you are making
these representions.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” groaned Hamilton—“you forget one great
point,” he said after a short pause.</p>

<p>“What is that, sir?” inquired Willmington.</p>

<p>“That by bringing Appadocca to the scaffold, you
will disgrace your own blood,” answered Hamilton.</p>

<p>“I do not care much for that, sir,” answered Willmington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“But you might show some consideration, at least, to
your own son,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“He did not show any to me,” sullenly replied
Willmington.</p>

<p>“That is no reason why you should not: and you
must recollect, he justified his harshness to you precisely
on the same grounds as you now do yours. Besides, he may
again, one day, justify any vengeance that he may be
inclined to wreak upon you by your conduct to day.”</p>

<p>“There will not be much chance left of his doing so,
I warrant you,” replied Willmington, with a sardonic
smile.</p>

<p>“There is many a slip between the cup and the lip,”
said Hamilton.</p>

<p>A pause ensued.</p>

<p>“Beside,” continued Willmington, re-opening the
dialogue—“besides, he is my son only of a sort.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean,” inquired Hamilton.</p>

<p>“That his mother was not Mrs. Willmington,”
answered Willmington.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, then, that you do not consider
you owe any duty to your children that may not have
been born in wedlock?” inquired Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” answered Willmington.</p>

<p>“You consider, therefore, that where the word of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
priest has not been pronounced on your union, you are
absolved from your honor, and from natural obligations?”
inquired Hamilton.</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Willmington.</p>

<p>The lips of the young officer curled up with scorn, as
he stood up and said, with ill-concealed disgust:</p>

<p>“Leave my cabin, sir; leave my cabin. By G—d you
are not made worse than you are. If I were Appadocca,
I should have hanged you outright, and not
sent you with a philosophical scheme to float on a cask
and to be picked up.</p>

<p>“Hark you, sir,” continued Hamilton, in a suffocating
temper, “if you have a son that resembles you more
than Appadocca does, born of Mrs. Willmington, understood—send
him to me, sir, and, by his own appointment,
I shall give him satisfaction for ordering you out of my
cabin.”</p>

<p>Willmington turned to leave, but met face to face a
servant that came rushing it.</p>

<p>“Your honour, your honour,” the man cried with
much excitement, “the pirate prisoner has drowned
himself.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Hamilton, and fell back into his
chair.</p>

<p>“The pirate prisoner, your honour, has jumped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
overboard. When the steward went into his cabin
this morning, he was not to be found: on examination,
the skylight was discovered to be open.”</p>

<p>The officer leaned his forehead on his hand.</p>

<p>“There, sir,” he said, “your vengeance is satisfied:
public justice and morality are vindicated.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” muttered Willmington between his teeth,
and left the cabin.</p>

<p>Charles Hamilton was deeply affected by the supposed
suicide of his friend; recollections of bygone days
crowded on his mind. He recalled vividly to himself
the happy hours which he and his friend Appadocca had
spent together in the lightheartedness and warm fellowship
which only students can feel, when strong and
mutual sympathy links them, and carries them together
through study and through recreation: he pictured to
his mind, the ardent and aspiring youth, such as his
friend then was, with a mind that was stored with learning,
and a heart that was overflowing with abundant
benevolence, and then contrasted him with the cold
soured, cynical man, whose mind was now entirely engrossed
with schemes of death and revenge, and whose
heart now beat but in cold indifference, or throbbed with
a more active feeling, only when retribution and punishment
quickened its action. He then thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
career which hope would have foretold on the one picture—a
career, that like the stars themselves which Appadocca
measured, was to be ever bright and brilliant, that might
have shed its light on humanity, and might, perhaps,
have signalized an epoch of philosophy and certain truth:
and he thought, on the other hand, of the actual reality
of a life spent in the degrading society of the reputed
scum of mankind, with its energies and powers exercised
and lost in devising methods for robbing others, and
closed at last in immorality and crime.</p>

<p>Such thoughts weighed heavily on Charles Hamilton,
and when he proceeded on deck, his step might be observed
to be less light, and his eye less quick than they
were wont to be.</p>

<p>As for James Willmington he walked on one side of
the deck restlessly, and bit his nails.</p>

<p>“The fellow,” he interjected to himself, “to go and
drown himself when I expected to have made him feel the
consequences of his insolence, in having me put on a cask
and set adrift. The villain! to go and drown himself,
when the gallows and the hangman’s hand ought to have
sent him to his account. Never mind, he is out of the
world, and one way is as good as another, there is
no fear now of being judged again in the name of
nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Willmington smiled satanically.</p>

<p>“He is gone, and that is one blessing, at least, and he
will, no doubt, meet those in the other world who will be
better able to answer his philosophy than I.”</p>

<p>And a diabolical smile played on the lips of that heartless
and selfish man.</p>

<p>“Have that man landed at once, Charles?” said the
commander dryly, who was attentively watching Willmington,
from the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>His attention had been at first attracted by the
restless and impatient movements of Willmington.
He had remarked the workings of his lips, and had
noticed the bitter sneer that settled upon them at the
end. The dislike which he had always entertained for
that man, was worked up to its height by this exhibition.</p>

<p>“He could not have been uttering a prayer for his
son,” he justly thought; “prayers do not end so. No—no—he
must be truly a vile individual. Death ought
to suspend, at least, the enmity of the bitterest foes. It is
a strange father that can curse the memory of his own
son, however great a reprobate he may have been.
Have that gentleman landed immediately, Charles,”
he again said to his son.</p>

<p>In a few moments, James Willmington was made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
acquainted with this order, and was told that a boat was
ready to take him ashore.</p>

<p>“Thank God, thank God!” he cried, almost aloud,
and quickly ascended the steps of the quarter-deck, to
take leave of the commander.</p>

<p>“My lord, I have to bid you, good morning,” said
he, as he approached the commander.</p>

<p>“Good morning,—good morning,” quickly replied the
person addressed, apparently desiring to have as little
as possible to say to the individual, who was taking his
leave.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you,” continued Willmington,
“for the protection and assistance, and—”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir,” dryly rejoined the commander, “I
have only discharged the duty which I owe to all His
Majesty’s subjects on these seas.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” pursued Willmington, “and I trust
my lord, when you land, you will condescend to remember
your former guest.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” replied the commander, as dryly,
as before.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my lord.”</p>

<p>“A very good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>The boat, soon bore Willmington away from the ship.</p>

<p>“If the world possessed many more like that man,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
said the commander to his son, while he pointed to
Willmington, who was now on his little voyage toward
the shore, “it would indeed be worse than a den of
thieves.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid there are many more of this sort, sir,
than you imagine,” replied Charles, “and that the
world is not even as good as a den of thieves, for they
say, those individuals recognize a certain code of
honor.”</p>

<p>“Things were not so in my time,” replied the commander;
“when I was young, Charles, we feared God,
honored the king, and dealt justly and honorably by
all men.”</p>

<p>“The times, then, are changed, sir,” said Charles,
“and the greatest misfortune is, that such characters as
that Willmington, unluckily for humanity, make as many
Appadoccas.”</p>

<p>“True,” observed the commander, “it is a misfortune.
I always thought I perceived much to be admired in
that unfortunate Appadocca. I am rather glad, I must
say, that he has drowned himself rather than permit
himself to be dealt with by the executioner.”</p>

<p>On landing, Willmington hurried up the magnificent
walk of almond-trees, which lead from King’s-wharf,
into Port-of-Spain. He pursued his way through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
city, and scarcely recognised the many wondering friends
and acquaintances, who proceeded forward to congratulate
him on his return, for they had heard of the accident which
had befallen the ship in which he had taken passage; and
also of the manner in which he, in particular, was treated.</p>

<p>When he had arrived at the beautiful Savannah
which lies at the Northern-end of the city, he diverged
into a footpath that led to the beautiful villas with
which Saint Ann’s-road is ornamented. He quickly
walked up the road a little way, and immediately stopped
at the gate of a magnificent and romantic suburban
house that stood in solitary grandeur, amidst the beautiful
trees that belted it.</p>

<p>He rang at the gate-bell, and was immediately admitted
by the servant, who started back, and almost
went into hysterics at seeing his master back again.</p>

<p>“Gad bless me, massa, da you, or you ’pirit?” inquired
that official, as he opened the gate and let his
master in, who, without noticing the wonderment of the
man, rushed into the house.</p>

<p>“Ah! is it you, Mr. Willmington?” said his wife,
with fear, surprise, and joy, all confusedly pictured on
her face.</p>

<p>“Heavens be praised, and thanked,” and she embraced
him affectionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me, tell me all about the accident that befell
you,” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, dear,” answered Willmington; “not
to-day, dear. Only thank Providence that I am again
safe. I shall relate everything when I am more composed.”</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that James Willmington
succeeded in restraining the curiosity of his
wife until the period which he himself had appointed to
tell her the particulars of the capture of the ship, and also
the singular circumstance of his trial, punishment and
rescue.</p>

<p>The period had now arrived.</p>

<p>In a beautiful and fantastic pavilion, into which
the soft evening breeze wafted the sweet perfume
of a thousand delicate flowers which bloomed around,
sat James Willmington. He was seated at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
a vast, spreading table that was loaded with the choicest
and most delicious fruits that the tropics produce. Opposite
to him sat Mrs. Willmington, on whose side two
very beautiful infant daughters were respectively placed.
On the right hand of Willmington was his son, a
youth of about eighteen, who was dressed in the uniform
of an officer.</p>

<p>The pure wax tapers that burnt in chaste and elegant
candlesticks of solid silver, shed a cheerful and soft light
around. The faint music of a small fountain that played
hard by, fell soothingly on the ear, as it grew louder and
louder, or fell fainter and still fainter, according to the
direction and strength of the lulling breeze that seemed
to sport with its jets. The old family pictures that
hung on the walls looked down fiercely and frowningly,
or smiled upon the happy and quiet group, according to
the stern and warlike disposition or the benignant characters
of each.</p>

<p>The servants had all retired for the time to their own
apartments; and Willmington sat quietly smoking an
exquisite cigar, and sipping from time to time the crystal
iced water that stood in a tumbler by his side.</p>

<p>“I shall now tell you,” he said, “the succession of
accidents which has brought me back to
Trinidad,” and he began to relate the particulars of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
capture of the merchant vessel, the distribution of the
shares, his trial, his being thrown overboard, the agony
that he suffered on the cask, and finally his providential
rescue, the capture of the pirate captain and his supposed
suicide. He narrated circumstance on circumstance,
quickly passed over the alleged causes of his sufferings,
and mentioned Appadocca as one who claimed to be his
son.</p>

<p>“Confound his impudence,” cried the youth of eighteen.
“I wish I had been there, I should have caned his insolence
out of him. The idea! to call my father, his
father, vile cut-throat as he was. I wish I had him now.
But do you know anything at all of him? How came
he to claim you as his father, sir?” he inquired, after
a time.</p>

<p>“Do not interrupt me;—do not interrupt me,” was
the only answer Willmington made to this home and
embarrassing question.</p>

<p>Time had flown during his long narrative. The clock
had already struck eleven—a late hour in the tropics—when
he was concluding.</p>

<p>“Yes, my children,” he said at the end, with great
solemnity, endeavouring to make the contemplated impression,
“there is one above to punish evil doers.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and he never slumbers,” replied a deep sonorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
voice from without, and in a moment afterwards the
pirate captain stood before James Willmington.</p>

<p>The cigar fell from his jaws, that palsied with terror,
now gaped asunder. His hands trembled, and threw
over the glass of iced water towards which it was being
stretched, his silvery hair seemed to stand on end, and
with a sudden bound, Willmington started from his seat
and reeled over his chair towards a corner of the
apartment.</p>

<p>“Get out of my sight, get out of my sight, accursed,
damned spirit; in the name of Christ, I conjure you!”
he cried, while his eyeballs glared, and large drops of
sweat trickled down his forehead that was almost
green with fear.</p>

<p>Appadocca calmly raised the chair from the floor, drew
it to the head of the table, folded his thin cloak around
him and sat down.</p>

<p>“I did not design to deliver you up to the authorities,”
shrieked Willmington, almost inarticulately. “No,
no! I had only intended to frighten you, I would have
allowed you to escape. Oh, yes, I would have protected
you; yes, yes, I would have protected you like a
father. Forgive, forgive me, and scare me no
more.”</p>

<p>Appadocca looked round upon the miserable Willmington,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
who, contracted with terror within the smallest
possible heap, crouched in a corner.</p>

<p>“Do not look at me,” cried Willmington still more
terrified, “vanish, vanish, in the name of Heaven and all
the saints. If you come from Hell—to-to haunt me,—return,
return. It was not I that wronged you. Forgetfulness,
forgetfulness—I intended—I intended always—always
to find you out. Your mother, aye, your—your
mother loved me. Have mercy—mercy—on me,—the
vessel—the vessel took me by—by chance to St.
Thomas. I did not—I did ask him: no—no—I was
sorry—sorry, when—when—you were drowned. Mercy—mercy.”</p>

<p>“Come here and make your will,” said Appadocca,
authoritatively, without paying the slightest attention
to the cries of the wretched and almost distracted
man.</p>

<p>“Make my will? will!” recommenced Willmington,
“do you intend to murder me? Hence, hence, I am
a christian, you have no power on me. No, no,—do not—do
not—out, out of my sight, damned, reprobate
spirit.”</p>

<p>“I am no spirit. Speak not to me so sillily. Make
your will, I say,” said Appadocca, with more authority,
“and do not let these children suffer from your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
loss. The minutes that you can remain with them are
counted.”</p>

<p>“Will, will!” exclaimed Willmington, as if already
staggering in his intellect.</p>

<p>“Will? I have no will to make. My will is made
already. Do not speak to me of wills—do not speak to
me of wills, I do not wish to die—I will not die. Leave
my sight—leave my sight—leave my sight.”</p>

<p>“Then settle your other affairs,” said Appadocca with
the same authority as before. “I allow you five
minutes; at the end of that time you must go with me.”</p>

<p>“No—no, I will not go with you,” shrieked Willmington,
“I did you no harm——I intended you no
harm. Let me live a little longer—give me but seven
years to live—five—two;—half a year;—a month—a
week, a day;—do not take me away so soon. Let me
live, let me live. Do not take me with you. It was not
I that drowned you.”</p>

<p>“It would be prudent on your part to fill the five
minutes, which are accorded you more profitably than
by these vain petitions. I—”</p>

<p>“Vain petitions! Let them not be vain; look at
the children that I have to maintain and protect: do not
take me away from them,” cried Willmington, interrupting
Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“I am no ghost,” continued Appadocca, “but something
worse.”</p>

<p>“Was he not drowned?” Willmington began to mutter.
“Did he not jump into the sea—at the bocas—or farther
out?—Can he—could he have been saved? no, no, delusion—delusion.
His face is as pale as death. He is
still and quiet as the grave;” continued Willmington,
as he gazed intently on Appadocca, who was still sitting
calmly at the table.</p>

<p>The period had elapsed, the moment of doom had now
arrived.</p>

<p>“The period is past, your time is come,” said Appadocca,
“rise and go with me.”</p>

<p>“No—no,” shrieked Willmington, madly,—“no—no—no.”</p>

<p>And with a sudden spring he jumped from the corner to
one of the doors: he was roughly thrown back by some
person who was outside: he then rushed to another, and was
again repelled—to another, and he was once more forced
back. He sprang on to the jalousies, and as he succeeded
in opening one, he was quickly shoved back by
some powerful arm from the outside, into the room
again.</p>

<p>Like one who endeavours to flee from devouring flames,
that rush in merciless fury to close him in, and finds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
every passage, every outlet, or crevice for escape barred
against him, the unhappy man reeled back into the room
in the madness of despair.</p>

<p>“Murder—murder,” he shouted, “John!—Charles!—James!—Edward!—Murder!—Murder!—pirates!—fiends,
pirates, robbers, police, police.”</p>

<p>“Ho! there! Domingo,—Gregoire!—Alphonso!—Jose!”
called Appadocca, with his habitual calmness.</p>

<p>Four men on the call entered the room. Their flashing
eyes shone from beneath their overhanging red caps,
and their long beards and mustachios exhibited a peculiar
appearance under the silvery light of the tapers,
which tended to display to the full their dark and dry
complexions.</p>

<p>“Secure him,” said Appadocca pointing to Willmington,
as the men entered.</p>

<p>“Do not touch him for your lives,” cried the young
officer, the son of James Willmington, that sat on his
right.</p>

<p>He, like his father, had been under the power of a
supernatural terror from the moment that Appadocca
entered, and had been addressed as a visitant from another
world; but when he became awake to the fact that the
intruder was a being of flesh and blood, he grasped his
sword that lay on a table, and rushed at Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Do not touch him for your lives,” he cried, while he
made a lunge at the breast of the pirate-captain who
still retained his seat. The point was already touching
the cloak of Appadocca, when the heavy weapons of some
unseen individuals from without, shattered the slender
sword into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>“Secure you the young man, Baptiste,” said Appadocca,
unmoved by the danger which he had so narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>A man immediately stepped into the room and threw
his arm round the unresisting young officer.</p>

<p>The four men had rushed upon Willmington. Despair
had maddened him into a sort of courage: he met the
foremost one of them half way, and grasped him around
the throat, with the clutch of death. The pirate also
seized him, and the two men, animated with passions
which though different in their natures were equally
fierce in themselves, grappled like madmen, and staggered
violently to and fro. The strong effort of the
pirate, could not throw off Willmington, who clung to
him with the tenacity of the serpent that tightens its
refolded coils around the triumphant tiger that still
presses its paw on its bruised head.</p>

<p>Lashed into rage, the pirate drew his knife: it gleamed
for a moment overhead, and was descending, with certain
death upon its point, when——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Hold!” cried Appadocca, “no blood; help him Gregoire,
Jose, help him, there.”</p>

<p>The voice of the captain arrested the disciplined
arm.</p>

<p>Spurred by the immediate commands of their chief,
the other pirates closed in upon Willmington, and by the
exercise of violent force tore him away from their comrade,
who stood for a moment with his eyes fiery and
glaring from anger, and with his chest heaving heavily
and quickly.</p>

<p>The prisoner kicked and shouted until the words rattled
hoarsely in his throat; but he was now in no soft
or gentle hands. Sooner than we can write it, he was
tied hand and foot; his cries, nevertheless, still resounded
through the place.</p>

<p>“Gag him,” was the immediate order.</p>

<p>The prisoner’s neckcloth was roughly undone, and
violently thrust into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Away with him.”</p>

<p>The pirates stretched out two pikes: the prisoner was
laid across them, they raised him on their shoulders, and
walked silently out of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Now unhand your prisoner, Baptiste,” said Appadocca,
to the man who held young Willmington. Baptiste
let go his hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“My father, my father,” shouted young Willmington
and rushed first to one door, and then to the other, all of
which he found guarded on the outside.</p>

<p>“Sir, you cannot go out,” said Appadocca.</p>

<p>“I will go out—I will go after my father,” ejaculated
young Willmington.</p>

<p>“You cannot, and shall not,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>The young officer rushed to all the doors in succession,
and was rudely pushed back at each.</p>

<p>“You see you cannot go out,” observed Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Who are you? what do you wish to do with my
father?” inquired the young Willmington, as he turned
disappointedly from the door.</p>

<p>“I shall tell you, by-and-bye,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Tell me at once, and let me out,” cried young
Willmington.</p>

<p>“That cannot be.”</p>

<p>“That must be: I must rescue my father,” rejoined
young Willmington.</p>

<p>“Banish the idea: you will never be able to do so,”
replied Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you will be prevented,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Prevented?—prevented? Hell, itself, with all its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
legions, shall not prevent me,” shouted young Willmington.
“I will rescue my father.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” answered Appadocca.</p>

<p>The young man rushed to the doors again, and was
thrust back as before. After a series of vain attempts,
he staggered, almost exhausted, into the centre of the
room.</p>

<p>“You see, sir, I make no ungrounded assertions. It
is impossible for you to follow your father,” said
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Why impossible? Confound you as a cut-throat—murderer,”
asked young Willmington.</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Appadocca, without noticing
the harsh epithets, “because he is implicated in a vow
that must be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“I understand no such vow,” said young Willmington,
“and if I had a sword, I should force my way in spite
of you.”</p>

<p>“Ha! we shall now understand each other, sir,” said
Appadocca, then threw aside his cloak, unbelted his
richly-ornamented sword, and laid it on the table. “You
can use that, sir,” he said to young Willmington, while
he pointed to it, and stepping towards the door—</p>

<p>“Lend me your sword,” he said to one of the men.</p>

<p>The person gave up his sword at once to Appadocca,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
who went round the room, and carefully bolted every
door, one after the other. After that, he said to his
men.</p>

<p>“Retire into the high road, and remain there until I call.”</p>

<p>The men retired from the doors, and Appadocca closed
with the same care the one by which he had entered.</p>

<p>He was now left in the apartment only with young
Willmington, Mrs. Willmington, who lay insensible on
the floor, where she had fallen at the appearance of
Appadocca, and her two infant daughters, who stared
on in a state of absolute stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said Appadocca to young Willmington,
standing by the table, and leaning on the sword which
he had borrowed, “allow me to speak to you. I am
your father’s son.”</p>

<p>“You are not,” indignantly remarked young Willmington.</p>

<p>“It is an honor,” said Appadocca with a smile, while
he bowed to the young man, “which I have never prized,
I believe your stock is stamped with a peculiar mark:
behold it!” and Appadocca opened his little finger as
widely apart as possible from the other, and pointed to
something between the two fingers.</p>

<p>Young Willmington looked, stared, and started back
in astonishment, but spoke not a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“He,” continued Appadocca, after this disclosure,
“treated me with harshness, injustice, and cruelty, and
wronged, in addition, one whose place I now supply,
and in whose name I seek vengeance. I owe him
nothing except punishment. I am, therefore, your
father’s sworn persecutor, and retributioner. You, he
has always treated with kindness and affection; the
bonds of natural obligation have been drawn the tighter
on you by good deeds. You are, therefore, by the
principles of justice, his natural defender. Now he is
named in a vow that I have made, and I cannot let you
rescue him. I have the power to prevent you from
making any attempt to that effect, and I shall do it.
But there is yet a satisfaction which I can give you, and
I shall do so. With my life, the persecution which is
now carried on against your father will cease; for I
shall leave none behind me to take up my cause. I am
willing, therefore, to throw life and death on a hazard,
and to afford you as fair a chance as possible of purchasing
your father’s deliverance by your valour and bravery.
My sword, which I offer you, is of the finest metal, you may
rely upon its fidelity. I challenge you to mortal combat.”</p>

<p>Appadocca put himself in an attitude of defence, bent
his left arm over his back, raised his head proudly, and
held his sword straight before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Young Willmington was undecided: he seemed to be
under the power of a thousand different and conflicting
feelings. There was no possibility of denying the well-known
family mark with which Appadocca was stamped;
he saw, consequently, before him his brother, by the laws
which nature had made, whatever he might be by those
which man had framed, and was forced to recognize in
that brother the prosecutor, enemy, and almost murderer
of his father. He was divided between two duties, the
duty which he owed to a father, and that which he owed
to a brother.</p>

<p>“I shall not fight with you,” he said after a
long pause. “If you grudge us any of his property,
take as much as you please, but render us back our
father.”</p>

<p>“Will not fight!” exclaimed Appadocca, “I had
imagined that your father was the only selfish coward
in an old race of reputedly brave men.”</p>

<p>“Coward do you call me?” inquired young Willmington,
with a frown.</p>

<p>“Ay, coward,” answered Appadocca. “First you made
a thrust at me when my attention was directed otherwise,
and now you seek to wound my feelings by supposing
the possibility that I could grudge you your father’s
wealth. Grudge, indeed! his most precious jewels would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
disgrace me. My men, however—the friends that
received me, shall enjoy it. Coward, ay, thrice four
times coward; again, and again, I proclaim you as
such.”</p>

<p>“No more, defend yourself,” cried young Willmington,
and he clutched the sword which Appadocca had
laid on the table.</p>

<p>Young Willmington warmly pressed on Appadocca
who still stood on the defensive. Thrust after thrust,
lunge after lunge came in rapid succession from young
Willmington. Respiration came short and quickly.
He made a desperate thrust at Appadocca, who with a
slight but quick movement of the wrist at once disarmed
his adversary.</p>

<p>Young Willmington bowed haughtily, while his face
grew crimson with vexation.</p>

<p>Appadocca quickly picked up the sword and presented
it again to the young officer.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am satisfied,” said the last-mentioned person,
and refused it.</p>

<p>“You ought scarcely to be so, sir. Recollect this is
the only chance that will probably be afforded you,” replied
Appadocca, “to recover your father. Try it
again.”</p>

<p>“Have you any object in pressing me to fight longer?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
By the law of arms you are not justified in thus asking
me again when I am defeated,” said young Willmington.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” answered Appadocca, “but you must
recollect this is a very particular case. To be frank, I
must confess I am scarcely satisfied with the chance that
I have afforded you, I like to satisfy justice, sir. Pray
try it again.”</p>

<p>“Strange man, I shall,” answered young Willmington,
and then began to prepare himself more deliberately for
this second combat.</p>

<p>The swords were again crossed. Willmington no
longer thrust so widely as he did—he fenced more
cautiously. Appadocca still maintained the defensive.
The combat proceeded but coldly—Willmington tried
every skilful pass and cunning trick. He had contrived
to edge his sword, as he imagined, imperceptibly to
Appadocca, within but a short distance from his adversary’s
hilt, and was just inclining his hand inwards to
thrust home, when Appadocca met the inclination by an
opposite movement, and by a sudden jerk again unarmed
his adversary.</p>

<p>“Sir, destiny seems to favour me at these. I presume
you have pistols, shall we try them?” inquired Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“It strikes me you are longing for my blood?” remarked
young Willmington.</p>

<p>“By no means,” answered Appadocca, “I have waded
through too much of that already. But I am willing to
give you the greatest opportunity of redeeming your
father. Then am I to understand that you will fight no
more?”</p>

<p>“No more,” answered young Willmington.</p>

<p>Appadocca drew forth a small silver whistle, he blew
it, and in a moment the pavilion was again surrounded by
his men.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Appadocca, on the arrival of the men, “the
safety of my followers require that you should be rendered
incapable of alarming the town. You must
consent to be gagged and bound. Ho! outside
there.”</p>

<p>Three or four pirates entered the room,</p>

<p>“Gag and pinion him,” said Appadocca, and pointed
to young Willmington.</p>

<p>In less than a few minutes the order was executed
upon him.</p>

<p>“Take him to the remotest room in the house.”</p>

<p>Young Willmington was carried bodily out of the
apartment.</p>

<p>“Ho! Jack Jimmy,” cried Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>That individual immediately rushed into the room,
trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“Rummage the whole house, and bring all the silver
and gold. Pedro, help him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa,” Jack Jimmy answered, and hurried
out of the apartment.</p>

<p>While Jack Jimmy and the other man were intent on
searching for whatever valuables the villa contained,
Appadocca seated himself on the same chair that still
stood at the head of the table.</p>

<p>His eyes had become gradually more and more intently
fixed on the two beautiful children, who clung in
wakeful unconsciousness to their pale and still insensible
mother.</p>

<p>They seemed actually petrified with fear, while their
large interesting eyes were firmly rivetted in a vacant
stare on the terrible being whose coming had brought
so much horror to the happy villa.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is too true,” muttered Appadocca, “the sins
of the fathers are visited on their children. Were it not
for the injustice of your father, my little ones, I should
not be here to-night to terrify you with my fierce and
unfriendly looks. If my heart had not been long seared,
if there was still in it one single portion that continued
as fresh as once the whole was, your silent looks, your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
unspeaking terror, would move me more than the eloquence
of a thousand glib-tongued orators. Nay, I
might, perhaps, forget my vow.</p>

<p>“How poisonously bitter are the cups that others
season for our lips? Still, may Heaven preserve in
your minds the deeds of to-night, and when you shall
have grown up, always recollect this sad retribution, and
speak a word whenever you may be able, and say that
you know, by the experience of a scene of your childhood,
that certain creatures who are branded and repudiated
by society are beings who possess feelings, and
who claim the same measure of justice as is meted out
to all.”</p>

<p>“Me get all, massa,” said Jack Jimmy, who now came
in with an air of serious importance.</p>

<p>Appadocca rose and pointed to the door; the two
men then walked off from the villa, and were immediately
followed by the captain himself.</p>

<p>The villa which, but a short time before, presented a
scene of domestic happiness, was now left in the desolation
of death, with the lights still burning, and the
superfluity of luxury still scattered about. The gate
was heavily drawn after them by the three persons that
had just passed through, and silence settled over the
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>The pirates, who with their prisoner and booty,
awaited the captain in the road, were drawn up in order,
and after saying a few words to an officer, Appadocca
gave the word to march, and they silently went down
the road. He himself remained behind.</p>

<p>It was dark, on a certain evening, to which the
attention of the reader is now called, when, amidst the
rocks and bushes of the mountainous district that
flanks Port-of-Spain on the east, and that is known by
name of La-vantille, two female forms might be perceived.</p>

<p>They were following a rough and narrow path which
led up to the mountains through a thousand rugged
ascents and yawning and frightful precipices. The two
travellers seemed foot-sore and exhausted, and were compelled
now and then to grasp a root or twig of the Guava-bushes
that grew here and there to assist them, as they
arrived at a more broken and difficult part of the small
road. The air was also oppressive—the rocks were still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
radiating the beams which the sun, that had not long
set, had shot full upon them as it was sinking in the
west. Nature was hushed: but the distant and faint
barking of the cur that guarded some invisible hut,
and bayed at some imaginary danger, fell on the ear.</p>

<p>The two persons still followed the path, and ascended
still higher and higher up the mountain that overlooks
Port-of-Spain.</p>

<p>“You are tired, madame,” said one of the persons,
whose dress indicated an humble condition in life, and
who was evidently conducting the other.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other, who appeared to be of a
different class.</p>

<p>“We shall not have very much farther to go,” said
the guide.</p>

<p>“The place is certainly a great distance from town,”
remarked the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, and the path is very rough and unpleasant;
but we shall presently come to a beautiful spot,
where we shall be able to rest for a few moments.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered the other; “it would be better
to proceed at once: the night is now quickly coming on,
and we do not know what dangers there may be among
these solitary rocks. What, if robbers were to attack
us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Robbers,” replied the other; “madame needs not
fear robbers; bless me, people would not take the trouble
to come and remain here for the purpose of robbing
others. Robbers are never heard of in Trinidad, I
assure you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed: I know persons who have traversed
this place at all hours of the night. I myself have
passed here on one of the darkest nights, and quite alone,
also: you need not be under any fear, I assure you.”</p>

<p>In the mean time the wayfarers arrived at a small
level piece of ground that was covered with grass. It
was quite an “oasis” in those rough and flinty parts.</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried the guide, “here is the place, let us rest
here,” and sat down on the grass. The lady did the
same.</p>

<p>“This is a beautiful little spot, is it not, madame?”
remarked the guide interrogatingly.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” answered the lady.</p>

<p>“If it was day, you should be able to see the whole
country round from this,” proceeded the guide: “on
that side is Caroni, where we first settled when my
master and his family came from Carriacou; a disagreeable
and muddy place, madame; there is Maraval,
a sweet pretty spot, with beautiful hills and scenes; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
straight before us lies the sea. If it were light, you would
be able to perceive the five islands, and the large bay
where Admiral Appadocca—”</p>

<p>At this name the lady started suddenly.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, madame?” asked the guide.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” hastily replied the lady.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed; it is, no doubt, a cricket, that
has jumped on you. There are not many snakes here:
Caroni is the place for them,” observed the female
cicerone.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, madame,—what was I saying?—I
was telling you about the large bay where
Admiral Appadocca—”</p>

<p>The lady started again, but more slightly than before.</p>

<p>“Let me drive it away for you,” said the guide, “these
crickets are sometimes very troublesome; but they are
a sign of good luck—they are a sign of good luck.
People say, those on whom they may happen to jump, are
sure to have money—plenty of money. Where is it?
let me catch it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, never mind,” the lady said hastily,
“continue, continue your story.”</p>

<p>“When Admiral Appadocca, I was saying, set the
Spanish ships on fire, at the time when the English
took the island, I remember the blaze they made.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
People say they were laden with gold: what a pity that
was.”</p>

<p>“Why did he set them on fire?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p>“Because he would not let the money fall into the
hands of the English,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>“And what became of the admiral himself?” the lady
inquired again.</p>

<p>“I really cannot say,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>A short pause ensued.</p>

<p>“Had he any son, do you know?” asked the lady
after a time,</p>

<p>“I do not know, madame,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>“The money that I spoke of just now, has been all
lost. They say that sometimes the fishermen manage
to bring up a portion. I don’t think that is true,” said
the guide.</p>

<p>“Do you not think we had better go on,” inquired
the lady—“I wish very much to see that old woman,
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” answered the guide, and the two
travellers continued their journey. As they proceeded,
the path became still more rough, steep, and trying.
They, however, went on.</p>

<p>“I should be very much disappointed,” said the lady,
“if after all this trouble and labour, the person that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
tell me of, should not be able to give me the information
I require.”</p>

<p>“Never fear that, madame, never fear that,” replied
the guide, “she is a wonderful woman.”</p>

<p>“Do you know of any instance in which, what she
said, turned out to be the truth?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“Bless me, yes, madame, great many, I can assure
you. She has often foretold what would happen, and
what she said, proved as true as possible.”</p>

<p>“She may be able,” said the lady, “to speak about
what is to come, but can she say any thing about the
present?”</p>

<p>“All,” replied the guide.</p>

<p>“Do you think, she will be able, to give me any
information, about the person whom I am now seeking?”
inquired the lady.</p>

<p>“I am sure she will,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>“Let us walk faster,” said the lady, and, at the
same time, quickened her pace.</p>

<p>“I should not advise you to walk faster, madame,”
said the guide, “we have still a considerable way to go.”</p>

<p>“True,” said the lady, and fell again into the
measured and leisurely pace of the guide.</p>

<p>“You are sure she will give me the information, you
say?” observed the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“Quite sure,” answered the guide, dryly, “I can
point you out a hundred families in town, who were
landed here as poor myself, and who made the great
fortunes they now possess, only by consulting her. In
the time of slavery, when a planter lost any of his
slaves, he had nothing else to do, but to come to her,
and she would send him to the very corner, where he
would be sure to find his run-a-way.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” cried the lady.</p>

<p>“It is true,”—replied the guide, “beside, she can
cure all sorts of disorders. Those that are pronounced
incurable by the doctors in town, resort to her, and are
sure to be restored to health.”</p>

<p>“I remember one case in particular,” said the guide,
seriously, “of a man who had been suffering for two
years, from a hand that was swollen to a very great
size. He could not get any rest, either night or day,
but groaned continually. He consulted every doctor—they
did everything in their power but could not relieve
him. His hand grew daily worse and worse: and he
was reduced to the size of a nail. Well, some one told
him about this old woman, and he came to her. She
examined the hand, then pressed the fingers; from under
the nails of each she took out a rusty pin. Next day
the hand was perfectly cured.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“Impossible,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” replied the guide.</p>

<p>“There is another case,” continued the guide, “that
is as striking. There was once an unfortunate man who
was afflicted with madness; sometimes he was quiet, at
others he would break out in the greatest violence and
beat his wife and children almost to death. All the
doctors saw him and said he was quite gone, there was
no curing him. His illness daily gained ground upon
him, until at last he went violently mad. His friends
were grieved on his account, and were at last persuaded
to take him to the old woman. They did so: as soon
as she saw him, she took a little stick and struck him on
the head; his skull opened: she took out twenty small
fishing hooks that were stuck into his brains; and
closed the skull again. In a few moments the man was
cured.”</p>

<p>“Is that possible?” exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable,” observed the guide.</p>

<p>“Did you see the cure yourself?” inquired the
lady.</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” answered the guide, “but every one
in the town knows it.”</p>

<p>The path in the meantime became more rugged, broken,
and steep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, we are now arrived,” said the guide, taking a long
inspiration.</p>

<p>The travellers made two or three steps forward, and
they immediately perceived a faint light that glimmered
indistinctly through the brushwood.</p>

<p>“Now, madame, you must disguise yourself, or else
she won’t speak to you,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied the guide, “there is a law in this
country against those who tell fortunes. If it was to
be known that she told anything to any one, she would
be burnt alive. Leave your veil here, madame, there,
so, and hide your comb with it. That’s it, that’s it; now take
this handkerchief, tie it round your head—let me do it.”</p>

<p>The guide tied and adjusted a Madras handkerchief
on the head of the lady.</p>

<p>“Now let us go: and recollect let me speak.”</p>

<p>The two travellers diverged into a still narrower part
that was almost entirely hidden by the bush which grew
thickly and fully about it.</p>

<p>The angry barking of a dog was now heard. The
travellers still went on, until they could now distinguish
the outlines of a low and narrow hut, in the open part
of which the embers of a wood fire still smouldered. By its
faint light, was to be indistinctly seen, the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
wakeful watch-dog, that stood determinedly a little way
in front of the hut, and barked fiercely and fretfully.</p>

<p>The two women stood, afraid of approaching nearer.
The dog still barked noisily.</p>

<p>“Ho, mother! mother Celeste,” called the guide.
“Mother Celeste!”</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>“She does not hear,” observed the lady, “she is
asleep; call louder.”</p>

<p>“Ho, Mother Celeste! Mother Celeste! it is I, it is
I,” repeated the guide.</p>

<p>Still there was no answer,—the dog barked still more
loudly.</p>

<p>“Heavens! I hope we have not come all this way for
nothing,” exclaimed the lady, in a voice that faltered
with anxiety.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped not,” answered the guide, and she
began to call out more loudly than before. “Mother
Celeste! Mother Celeste!”</p>

<p>“Who is is that comes to disturb me at this lonely
hour of the night?” said a weak and obscure voice, that
came from within the fragile hut.</p>

<p>“It is I, it is I, and another person, who wish to see
you,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>“You cannot see me to-night. I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
what you have to see me about,” answered the same
voice.</p>

<p>“We have come a great distance, and we cannot
return without seeing you: let us in.”</p>

<p>“I cannot open my door at this hour of the night,”
replied the voice: “return.”</p>

<p>“That we cannot,” replied the guide. “Call your
dog, Mother Celeste, and open the door to us; you will
see what a present we have brought you.”</p>

<p>“What present can you bring me this time of night?”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars, Mother Celeste, fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“I can’t open to you,” replied the voice, “I can’t
open to you.”</p>

<p>“Say a hundred,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Well, a hundred dollars,” cried the guide.</p>

<p>“It is very late, I do not know who you may be; I
shall consider—I shall consider,” said the same voice.</p>

<p>“She will open now,” said the guide, “that is what
she always says, she is now hiding all her things.”</p>

<p>Truly enough, in a short time, the voice from within
was again heard.</p>

<p>“Approach, my children; come and tell me your
woes,” it said.</p>

<p>“But the dog, the dog,” cried the guide.</p>

<p>“True,” replied the same voice, “Fidele, Fidele,” it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
called, and the dog immediately became silent and
disappeared.</p>

<p>The two females now approached the hut. It was a
little cabin, that was built of a few pieces of round timber,
which were now black with smoke. Palmeto leaves
formed a slight covering to it. A few reeds roughly
fastened to the primitive posts, fenced in the part which
lay in the direction from which the wind usually came.
The other, or inner part of the hut, however, was fenced
entirely in, and covered, as the sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>“Wait until I strike a light,” said the same voice.</p>

<p>In a few moments a rudely constructed old door
opened.</p>

<p>“Enter, enter, quickly, my children,” said the same
voice.</p>

<p>The lady hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“Go in, go in, madame,” said the guide, and gently
pushed her.</p>

<p>The two travellers entered.</p>

<p>The hut presented as peculiar an appearance on the
inside as it did on the outside. The rough pieces of
Palmeto bark that boarded it, was hung with drapery
of spider’s webs, that either floated black with time
and dust, or was still spread in the process of extension,
under the industry of the master insect himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
From crooked nails, that were driven into this primitive
wall, a number of bottles, of peculiar fashions and makes,
hung suspended by cord that had long lost its colour
under the many dyes which it may have received from
the black, yellow, green, brown, and bluish liquors
which those bottles seemed to contain.</p>

<p>In one corner stood a rough bed, that seemed constructed
of four branches of a Guava-bush; and around,
a number of nasty, greasy, barrels were ranged, and had
their heads carefully covered over by pieces of plastered
old canvass.</p>

<p>In one of the deep angles of the hut there burnt a
lamp, constructed of a hollow gourd, in which some
cotton and some oil were adjusted, and was made to
throw around a dim light, whose faint radii did not extend
farther than a foot or two beyond its centre.</p>

<p>At the side of this lamp was huddled up a being
which at first view, might appear to be one from whom
life had long departed, and whom the veneration of
friends or kindred persisted in still retaining among them.
She was a little black woman of diminutive size, with an
old greasy dress, that lay slack and loose about her.
Her knees were drawn up to her jaws, which protruded
largely and hideously. Her skin was shrivelled and dry,
and seemed to flap as she moved her toothless jaws. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Madras handkerchief was tied carelessly round her head,
and from a corner, or a hole here and there, her short
gray and matted hair peeped out.</p>

<p>“Good night to you, Mother Celeste,” said the guide,
as she drew a three-legged stool for the lady, and sat,
herself, on the ground.</p>

<p>“Good night to you, my children, good night,” said
Mother Celeste.</p>

<p>“I have brought this friend of mine,” said the guide,
“to see you on a matter of great importance.”</p>

<p>“To see me? to see me, my child,” mumbled Mother
Celeste: “what can I do for her, poor old woman as I
am, except give her my blessing?”</p>

<p>“She wants some information about a person she is
seeking,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“How can I give it, how can I give it, my child?”
answered Mother Celeste.</p>

<p>“Try, mother, try,” remarked the guide.</p>

<p>A pause ensued, during which Mother Celeste seemed
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“What friend of yours is this, my child?” inquired
Mother Celeste.</p>

<p>“She is from the Spanish main,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>Mother Celeste raised the rude lamp to the face of the
lady: “Yes, yes,” she muttered, and replaced it on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
ground, and then grasped her hand: the lady started
when she felt the rough hacked skin of the sorceress.</p>

<p>“Do not start, my child,” said Mother Celeste, “do
not start; and now tell me your story,” she mumbled.
“Will you go into the front awhile?” she added to the
guide.</p>

<p>The latter opened the little door, and went out.</p>

<p>“I love,” said Feliciana, whom the reader may have
recognised before this, “I love a man—a stranger to me—I
cannot tell you how I love him. He was taken to
my father’s house, from the beach on which he was found
half drowned. I loved him the very first moment I
saw him, he is so handsome. He suddenly left my
father’s house, and now I wish to know where to find
him. Do tell me: there are a hundred dollars for you.”</p>

<p>The sorceress clutched the money and pressed her
flabby lips to it again and again, then tottered towards
her rude bed and laid it under her pillow.</p>

<p>“Yours is a difficult case, child,” mumbled the old
woman.</p>

<p>“What is the man?”</p>

<p>“Alas, mother,” answered Feliciana, “I fear he is a
pirate.”</p>

<p>“Is he short or tall?”</p>

<p>“Tall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“Dark or fair?”</p>

<p>“Pale.”</p>

<p>“Retire for a moment, child,” said mother Celeste.</p>

<p>Feliciana went out of the small apartment.</p>

<p>An hour passed. During this time, Feliciana and her
guide were alarmed by the horrible noises that were heard
from the room of the sorceress. Now the most fearful
yells—now the most heart-rending groans broke
forth—the violent stamping of several individuals
were at one time heard, at another, the strangest
jargon grated harshly on the ear, while, at the same
time, the stench that penetrated through the chinks
in the partition almost suffocated those without.</p>

<p>Feliciana and her guide trembled in utter fear.</p>

<p>“Shall we run away?” said one to the other.</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered Feliciana, her whisper almost inarticulate
with terror.</p>

<p>Even at this trying moment the thought of
Appadocca was the most powerful in her mind.
The hope of finding him, sustained her against all
terrors.</p>

<p>At the end of the hour the little door of the hut was
violently opened, and the little sorceress was seen standing
in a body of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>“Seek your lover, amidst the tombstones to-morrow,
at the lonely hours of night,” she said, and the door was
violently closed.</p>

<p>This uncertain answer fell on the ears of Feliciana like
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>“Oh, he is dead—he is dead,” she cried, and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>The guide stood aside and allowed the young lady to
give vent to her sorrow.</p>

<p>“Who knows, madame,” she said, after a few moments,
“the answer may not mean that.”</p>

<p>The young lady raised her head for a moment, a new
thought seemed to strike her.</p>

<p>“Let us ask,” she said, “let us ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she will not open the door now, for the world,”
the guide replied.</p>

<p>“Will she not? Mother Celeste, Mother Celeste,”
cried Feliciana.</p>

<p>The barking of the dog that now reappeared drowned
their voices.</p>

<p>“I tell you, madame, she will not open the door,” said
the guide. “I ought to know her, since I bring people
to her almost every day.”</p>

<p>Feliciana remained buried in thought where she was
for a moment. “Let us go,” she shortly said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>The two travellers began to retrace their steps towards
Port-of-Spain.</p>

<p>Feliciana was sad and pensive; the guide was less
talkative than before, and after half-an-hour’s walk, the
barking of the dog still reached their ears.</p>

<p>Appadocca stood for a while, and watched his men,
who, in military order, were marching down the dark
and solitary road. When even their footsteps could no
longer be heard; he cast one more look on the desolated
villa, that still shone resplendently under the many
lights which burnt within, and that now presented the
appearance of a place, in which the pleasures of a marriage
feast, may have been broken in upon, by some
unexpected and chilling calamity.</p>

<p>What ever reflections he may have made, while he
gazed at the house before him, were short and transitory
and perhaps unpleasant, for he suddenly turned away
his head, and bent his steps rapidly towards the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Savannah, that opened before the splendid house of
James Willmington.</p>

<p>Having immediately approached the Savannah,
Appadocca climbed over the iron rails that enclose it,
and got within.</p>

<p>The night was one of a peculiar sort. It was dark,
but the air was soft and dry, and the numberless stars
that shone, seemed to twinkle more, and more, and
more brightly, and by their brilliant light, the imaginative,
may have seen, or fancied to have seen, to a vast
depth into the bluish ethereal fluid, in which they were
suspended. Appadocca directed his steps immediately
across the Savannah. He walked on pensively and
moodily, without even raising his head for a moment, to
gaze on the stars above; or, to listen to the faint and
peculiar insect-sounds, that might now be heard, amidst
the general calm and lull of nature.</p>

<p>When he had arrived at the western end of the
Savannah, he again climbed over the railing, and found
himself in the road which runs parallel in that direction,
with the Saint Ann’s road, on the opposite side. He
then diverged towards the left, and continued down the
road, until he had arrived to a certain street, which ran
to the right.</p>

<p>Appadocca walked along this street, and was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
to stop from time to time, in order to drive away the
numbers of dogs that followed, and that kept up an
unceasing noise at his heels.</p>

<p>The street opened on the extensive cemetery, that lies
to the west-ward of Port-of-Spain, and that looks picturesque
and beautiful by day, under the grove of
magnificent trees, that shelter it; but which, by night,
looks as dark and as gloomy, as the thoughts themselves
which it calls up.</p>

<p>Appadocca stood for a moment, and looked over the
wall; no one, nothing was to be seen, save a few white
and spotted goats, that silently cropped the grass at a
distance, or frisked capriciously over the tombstones.</p>

<p>He scaled the wall, and held his way straight down
the road, which lies concealed beneath the thickly
knotted branches of the trees that overhang it, and that
unseen, leads into the innermost parts of that long and
lasting home of thousands.</p>

<p>Having reached the utmost end of this road, he turned
towards the left, into one of the many cross-formed
paths, that bisect the cemetery. He walked carefully
along, and examined attentively every tomb that he
passed, until he had arrived at a simple grave, that
with a plain cross at its head, lay sheltered beneath the
rich spreading foliage, of a thick cluster of bamboos.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Here Appadocca stood, and remained motionless and
entranced, at the foot of that unornamented tomb; his
arms were folded over his breast, and he was in the
attitude of one whose thoughts were veiled in an
absorbing and holy feeling.</p>

<p>In a moment he approached nearer and nearer; then
seated himself down at the head of the grave, and
remained there, his brow resting on his hand, as if his
spirit was in communion with that of the body which
the grave contained.</p>

<p>Time fled, still the pirate captain remained in the
same position. The deeds of a whole life-time, one
would have said, were returning in rapid succession on
his memory. The pursuits, the pleasures and pains, the
endearments and enjoyments of childhood, of boyhood,
of youth, of all, seemed to fly back like administering
angels, or like fiends of hell upon his mind; for his recollections
were freshened, his sensibilities were awakened
by his mother’s grave:—his mother’s grave, which he
approached now a different man from what he was, when
he bade the farewell which proved the last on earth to
that mother. He had left her with the halo of those
virtues, which she had taught more by example than by
precepts, still surrounding his head, with his spirits fresh
and expanding, with his heart good and at ease, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
his intellect aspiring higher and higher; now he revisited
her in the cold tomb, with a callous indifference
either to virtue or to vice, with a heart that was poisoned
to the centre, with spirits lacerated and torn to shreds
and tatters. How to wreak retribution now engrossed
his whole intellect—retribution on the man whom that
mother had once too fondly loved, and whose placid
nature had, no doubt, long long forgiven. How could
he be certain that her spirit now looked down upon him
with pleasure, the spirit of her whose life was a speaking
lesson of patient endurance.</p>

<p>Such might be the feelings and thoughts of Emmanuel
Appadocca, whose manhood could not restrain the tears
that trickled down his cheeks, and flowed, as it were, in
mockery over the hilt of the sword that lay across his
knees, and moistened the mound before him.</p>

<p>The fleeting hours glided by, Appadocca was in the
same position. The brilliant stars shone beautifully
above him, the fire-flies played about the tombstones,
the tall dark trees rustled, and the pliant bamboos
creaked melancholily before the gentle night breeze.</p>

<p>“I may not look upon you again: still, let me—let
me perform, perhaps, the last office that I may be permitted,”
said Appadocca, as if speaking to some one by
his side, and began to pluck the weeds that grew over
the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>Time passed quickly. His labour was completed.
Appadocca took one last and earnest gaze at the grave,
then muffled his cloak leisurely around him, and turned
moodily away.</p>

<p>He followed the same path that led to the grave, and
came out on the wide gravelly walk. His footsteps
echoed in the silence of the hour, and he proceeded with
his eyes fixed upon the ground. From time to time,
however, he raised them to look at the morning star.
He had now done so, when he beheld before him a tall
female form, that was clad in black, standing under the
branches of a rose-apple tree, which edged the road.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” muttered Appadocca, “is there, then,
such a thing as a spirit?”</p>

<p>He stood for a moment.</p>

<p>“Oh, human mind,” he cried, “how weak thou art
in all thy greatness! how imperfectly thou canst cut
away the indifferent portions of thyself. Behold, whither
imagination now hurries thee. Can there be such a
thing as a spirit?”</p>

<p>Appadocca began again to walk. The form began to
advance towards him. They met.</p>

<p>“Appadocca,” it cried, and grasped the hand of the
pirate captain.</p>

<p>“Feliciana! impossible: my ears play upon me,” said
Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“No, no: it is—it is Feliciana; Feliciana, who has
tracked you from her father’s humble house, and who
will still follow you as long as life continues under the
labours she will undertake for you, and the privations
she may have to endure on your account.”</p>

<p>“At this place, and at this dismal hour!” remarked
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Better this place with all its horrors than the palace
in which I could not find you,” answered Feliciana.</p>

<p>“Strange devotedness,” muttered Appadocca.</p>

<p>“But how came you to know that I was here,” asked
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“A sorceress told me you would be,” answered Feliciana.
“I entered this cemetery. Heavens, how I
trembled! and trod its solitary walk, and examined
each whitened monument until—until—I—saw you—at—at—a
grave. Return, return, with me, let me pray
with you, let me join my prayers with yours.”</p>

<p>On saying this, Feliciana proceed down the walk,
and led the unresisting captain after her.</p>

<p>Arrived at the simple grave, she threw herself on her
knees, and began to pray. Appadocca stood by, now
resting on his sword.</p>

<p>“Oh grant,” said the lady, in conclusion to her
prayer; and she repeated the part aloud, “grant that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
his heart may be turned from the unholy pursuit which
now throws his soul into the hands of demons, and let
the spirit of his mother inspire him with the thoughts
that she possessed.”</p>

<p>This loud conclusion sounded solemnly in the silence
of the night. The sternness of Appadocca’s character
could scarcely resist it.</p>

<p>“Come and join me; say you renounce the life you
now lead,” said Feliciana.</p>

<p>Appadocca made no answer.</p>

<p>“Come, come—for your mother’s sake, come,” said
Feliciana.</p>

<p>“Pray you, senora. I will not pray, and I cannot
renounce.”</p>

<p>“I entreat you: imagine you behold the mother that
you have loved so much, making the same petition to
you. Could you refuse her?”</p>

<p>“Senora, speak no more on this theme, I say I cannot
renounce; my vow is made.”</p>

<p>“Heaven looks not upon unholy vows; not on vows
of vengeance,” said Feliciana, “renounce your life and
forget that oath.”</p>

<p>“Senora, the morning star is sinking; my followers
must be growing impatient. I must go;” and Appadocca
moved a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>Feliciana sprang from her knees and grasped him
by the hand; “do not go from this spot the same man
as you came to it. Wash yourself by prayer from the
blood which you may have shed, and ask—ask her
spirit to forgive you, if you offended it.”</p>

<p>Appadocca drew his hand quickly across his brow.
“Feliciana, your are ungenerous, unkind: my—feelings—require—no—further
laceration. Life and my miseries
have already made me too, too well acquainted with anguish.
Spare me, spare me the thought of an offended
mother—the only—the only—the only—friend that I
had in this bitter, bitter, world.”</p>

<p>“Say—say not so,” quickly rejoined Feliciana, still
more melted by the grief of one who appeared always so
indifferent. “You have still, still a friend. Oh fly,
fly with me to some wilderness; there enjoy your
thoughts, your silence, your feelings. I shall be your
slave, your dog, that will gather the inkling of the wish
from your very eyes. My <i>fallucha</i> is by the shore;
Appadocca will you go?”</p>

<p>A pause ensued.</p>

<p>“No, no, Feliciana,” said Appadocca; “I shall not:
lean not, good, good girl, upon a broken reed. To me
all things, save one idea, are stale and indifferent. My
life is gloomy, dark, and troublesome: my existence is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
already a heavy, heavy oppression. My soul, like the
cumbrous tower, fell but once, it can never rise
again. Your presence would create a new grief in me,
for I could not see you love one whose blood was
chilled.”</p>

<p>“I require no love—I require no love,” quickly rejoined
Feliciana, “I shall be your slave.”</p>

<p>“That, I shall not endure; my idol is woman. I
ought to worship, not she.”</p>

<p>“Still you will let me follow you?” eagerly inquired
Feliciana.</p>

<p>“No, no, my career may still lie through blood,” answered
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Speak no more of blood,” cried Feliciana, “forswear
your vengeance.”</p>

<p>“Never,” answered Appadocca sternly.</p>

<p>“Say, why doom yourself for ever,” Feliciana was going
to inquire—when—</p>

<p>“That the world may profit by my conduct,” answered
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“But the world will not know, will not attend to what
you do.”</p>

<p>“I care not, I care not,” answered Appadocca, “my
word is passed and I shall fulfil it. I am resolved, the
sacrifice must be made.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“But see, the morning star is sinking fast. I must
away.”</p>

<p>“But do not——”</p>

<p>“Come, come, let me lead you hence,” so saying
Appadocca grasped the arm of the faint Feliciana, and
hurried out of the cemetery.</p>

<p>They walked down the street that runs from north to
south on the western side of Port-of-Spain, and soon
reached the principal landing-place, where the crew of
the Black Schooner were impatiently waiting for their
captain.</p>

<p>“Feliciana, I bid you a long, long adieu,” said Appadocca,
as they stopped under one of the almond trees
that form the shady walk we have already mentioned.</p>

<p>“Do not say so,” said Feliciana indistinctly, as she
leaned against the tree, “oh do not say so.”</p>

<p>There was no answer, not a word.</p>

<p>“Feliciana let me ask you—to—to—place this near
your heart, and whenever you gaze upon it, let one
thought return—to—to—the—the sick man of your
father’s house.” So saying, Appadocca drew his sword
and cut off a lock of his flowing hair, and presented it
to the lady.</p>

<p>“Look—look—there,” she cried faintly, as she received
the token.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>Appadocca turned round and beheld a crowd of people
who, with torches and lanterns, were following a company
of soldiers that were marching quickly down the walk.</p>

<p>“Flee,” cried Feliciana.</p>

<p>“One more request,” said Appadocca. “Forget not,
Feliciana, the place where you first saw me to-night. If
foul and rank weeds grow upon it, pluck them as you
pass by. Farewell, farewell.”</p>

<p>Appadocca walked down the wharf and was received
by his men.</p>

<p>“Shove off,” he cried, as he threw himself on the
stern sheets of the boat, and folded his cloak around
him.</p>

<p>The soldiers arrived at the wharf just in time to see
the boat disappear in the gray light of the morning.</p>

<p>They fired—the air resounded with their repeated
volleys.</p>

<p>It was not until an early hour of the morning, when
Mrs. Wilmington recovered from her swoon, that it was
possible to give any alarm of the outrage that had been
committed at the villa of James Willmington.</p>

<p>When the lady recovered from her state of insensibility,
and saw before her the scattered and disordered
furniture, the flickering wax candles that had now
burnt down to the very sockets, and her children, who,
after the departure of the pirate party, had fallen asleep
around her, recollections of the supposed apparition,
and of the terror of her husband, flashed across her mind.
Alarmed at the silence that reigned around, and not
being able to understand why she had been permitted
to remain in the same place where she had fainted away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
she rushed impulsively to the bell, that lay on the sideboard,
and rang it violently.</p>

<p>No one came.</p>

<p>She rang again—no one came: she rang again, and
again, more and more violently; still no one came.</p>

<p>She then looked out of the parlour, and beheld the
whole house still lighted up. She ventured out a little,
and still a little farther, until she summoned sufficient
courage, traversed the court yard, and entered the
servant’s apartments.</p>

<p>In the principal room nothing was to be seen. Mrs.
Willmington raised the light high up, while she stood
at the entrance, and looked into every corner and hole.
She could see nothing.</p>

<p>“Good God! can I be abandoned here with my
children,” she said in a low tone, fearful to hear even
her own voice, in such a silent and deserted situation.</p>

<p>She entered the room, and proceeded towards a door,
which opened into another apartment. She turned the
handle, and went into that room also; nothing was to
be seen. She was turning to leave, when a low groan
was heard. Mrs. Willmington started two paces backwards,
but raised the light and looked back intently
towards the part from which the groan came. In a dark
recess, that lay in a remote corner of a room, two white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
shining balls seemed to glare upon her. She started
still farther back: another groan was heard; she raised
the light still higher; it fell upon a part of the recess,
and discovered the shining face of the individual to whom
the eyes belonged and from whom the groans proceeded.</p>

<p>“It is Jack, it is Jack!” cried Mrs. Willmington,
and walked up towards the recess.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Jack, who had his mouth as well
filled with grass and cloths as it could possibly hold, and
whose arms were as tightly tied behind his back, as
mortal arms could be: and whose short legs were
stretched straighter than they had ever been stretched
before in Jack’s life. He was lying on his side, and his
eyes were playing in their sockets like those fierce-looking
things which German ingenuity has designed
to represent the visual apparatus of man, and which
are to be seen every day in some of the back streets
of London in full play, to the infinite excitement
and gratification of the awe-struck and wondering
urchins.</p>

<p>“Jack, cook!” cried Mrs. Willmington, “what state
is this you are in?”</p>

<p>“Jack, cook,” groaned, and his eyes played still more
rapidly.</p>

<p>“How can I assist?” said Mrs. Willmington, “I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
of it!” she ran hastily out of the room, and returned a
few moments afterwards, with a large knife.</p>

<p>With this, she cut the cords which bound the limbs
of the unfortunate Jack. A task of no little labour, for
those who secured him, had done so with a marvellous
amount of skill and success.</p>

<p>“Do the rest for yourself, now,” she said, when she had
completed part of the work.</p>

<p>Jack required no exhortation, but as soon as his arms
were free, he began with all his might to pluck out the
number of things, with which his not incapacious mouth
had been filled.</p>

<p>“Tenk Gad,” he cried, as he nimbly jumped on his
legs, and shook himself like a newfoundland dog coming
from the water.</p>

<p>“Where is your master?” quickly inquired Mrs.
Willmington.</p>

<p>“Me massa, ma’am!” answered Jack in the manner
that is rather peculiar to his class.</p>

<p>“Yes, your master; and where are the other servants?”
Mrs. Willmington asked again.</p>

<p>“Dem gane?” asked Jack again, in his turn.</p>

<p>“Who, gone?” inquired Mrs. Willmington.</p>

<p>“De paniole, ma’am:” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Jack, will you; tell me quickly,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Mrs. Willmington, now waxing impatient, “where is
your master and the other servants?”</p>

<p>“Let me see if dey gane,” said Jack, and he walked on
tiptoe towards the door, then carefully and cautiously
peeped out, then ventured a little way into the courtyard,
then ran hurriedly towards the great gate, and
bolted it and rebolted it.</p>

<p>“Awh!” he cried, “Garamighty! Dey gane now!
awh! me, neber see such ting in all my barn days.
Wha dat? Me hab time foo blow now: put big, big,
bundle so nan me mout! tap my breath, awh! But
me can blow now—tshwh, tshwh!” and Jack took along
breath in the fashion which seems to be peculiar to his
people—a fashion which compresses a vast quantity of
air, and sends it vehemently forth, so that the same
hissing noise which the steam makes when it comes
through the valve of a railway engine, is produced. A
fashion which, be it said within parentheses, may be
very economical, inasmuch as it affords a certain large
amount of respiration within a certain small period of
time.</p>

<p>This soliloquy, in the making of which, the illustrious
cook by no means limited himself as to time, being over,
and after having cast searching glances about the gate,
and having looked and relooked above, below, sideways,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
before, and behind, Jack then, and not till then, deemed
it proper to return to his mistress, who had also come
to the door, and was endeavouring to discover what the
cook was about.</p>

<p>“Me shet it, ma’am, me shet it,” cried Jack, as he
returned.</p>

<p>“Now, perhaps, you will tell me what I ask,” said
Mrs. Willmington, getting still more excited and angry,
“where is your master?”</p>

<p>“Tap, missus,” answered Jack, “I’ll tell you all
bout it.”</p>

<p>“Make haste, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, missus,” said Jack, and began to tell all about it.
He had the preliminary caution, however, of looking
carefully round to see if no more “paniole,” as he called
the pirates, were concealed thereabouts. Being for the
time satisfied on that point, he proceeded—</p>

<p>“Last night, ma’am—no, the night before the night,
ma’am, ee already dis ma’aning, Bekky come in, and
find me da smoke me pipe. ‘Good night.—’”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with Mr. Willmington, Jack?
Tell me where your master is, will you,” said Mrs. Willmington,
still more angry.</p>

<p>“Me da tell you, missus,” answered Jack. “‘Good
night, buddee Jack,’ say Bekky, says she. ‘Good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
night, sissee Bekky,’ me say, says I. ‘Awh! Jack!’
Bekky say, ‘wha tobacca you da smoke dey Jack,
ee smell bad! da——’”</p>

<p>“No more of this, Jack,” said Mrs. Willmington;
“tell me.”</p>

<p>“Tap, missus, tap, if you plase; me da come to it,
me da come to it now,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willmington looked resignation itself.</p>

<p>“‘Da tobacca I buy dis ma’aning, Bekky,’ me
say ma’am,” continued Jack; “and dat was all. Last
night wen me finish de fowl, and bin da clean the
kitchen, who me see, but Bekky. ‘Good even, buddee
Jack,’ she said, says she. ‘Good even, sissee,’ I say, says I.
‘Look, some good tobacca a bring foo you, Jack,’ she say;
and give me a bundle tobacca. So last night, when I sen
in the dinna, I went into the garden foo try dis tobacca.</p>

<p>“Me sit down unda de bread-fruit tree; me tink me
see somebody walk in de garden. Garamighty! me
say, wha jumbee want early, early so. Me look agin,
and me see de purson hab big, big beard like Paniole.
Me frieghten! Da who you, me bin go halla out, and
bin da go run away, when somebody hold me fram
behind, and chucked grass and ivery ting into my mout,
tie me han an foot, and trow me into the little room
way you fin’ me ma’am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“And where is your master?” asked Mrs. Willmington.</p>

<p>“Me no know, ma’am,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“And where are the servants?”</p>

<p>“Me no know, ma’am,” again answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Rummage the house, you simpleton,” said Mrs. Willmington,
and lighted him the way to the other parts.
Jack went cautiously, and turned his head round in all
directions.</p>

<p>They entered another room. “Garamighty! Jim,
dey tie you, too,” exclaimed Jack, as his eyes alighted
upon the “Jim” who was exactly in the same predicament
from which Jack himself had but a short time ago been
delivered.</p>

<p>The only intimation of intelligence that Jim could
make was, rolling his eyes about.</p>

<p>All the apartments were now searched, and the servants
were found, one here, the other there, among
them. They said that they were all simultaneously
laid hold of by a number of “panioles,” and were
gagged, bound hand and foot, and deposited separately
in the different rooms.</p>

<p>“And where is your master; and your young master?”
asked Mrs. Willmington.</p>

<p>“Dey carry old massa away pon their shoulders,
ma’am, and dey took young massa up-stairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“Heavens!” cried Mrs. Willmington, “and was it not
then a spirit?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He looked more like a paniole than a pirit, ma’am,”
said the individual who gave the information, who was
the chief servant in the house, and whose especial
destiny it had been to be gagged and otherwise dealt
with in his pantry, wherein he was at the moment busy
about some particulars connected with his avocation.</p>

<p>“Run up stairs. Go you, Edward, to—to—Mr. ——,
the magistrate; alarm the town; tell the soldiers at
the fort,” exclaimed Mrs. Willmington, while she herself
rushed up-stairs with a servant.</p>

<p>Young Willmington was found duly gagged and tied
in the favourite style of the pirates. He was immediately
released, and he got up from the bed on which the kind
consideration of the unwelcome visitors had laid him.
He exhibited less pleasure at his freedom than one
would have expected to see.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, James?” said Mrs.
Willmington, not a little surprised at the strange calmness
of her son. “Do you know that your father has
been carried away from his house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I know it.”</p>

<p>“Then why not make more haste, James, and go to
see about it?” rejoined Mrs. Willmington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“I shall go,” said young Willmington, after a pause,
“but my mind misgives me about this whole affair.
My father ought not to have concealed the truth from
us. The man who came into the house, last night, is
my brother.”</p>

<p>“Your brother!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear mother; he possesses the family peculiarity,”
answered James. “However, I shall go and
alarm the authorities.”</p>

<p>The magistrates were awakened, the alarm was given
at the forts, and the whole town was shortly in commotion.
The streets were searched, but no pirates could
be found. A body of soldiers was then marched down
to the wharf, as the reader already knows.</p>

<p class="tb">At early dawn the magistrates went alongside the
English man-of-war, and related to the commander what
had taken place.</p>

<p>“There is not much mystery about all this, gentlemen,”
said the commander, after he had reflected a
moment, “I shall promise you, that when it is clear, you
will be able to see a long, sharp, and strange-looking
schooner in these waters. I have, unfortunately, been
made too familiar of late with the boldness of that set of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
pirates. I am so certain of what I am telling you, that
I shall at once give orders for weighing anchor: so that
I shall be ready, as soon as it is light, to give chase,
and I shall see,” muttered the commander to himself;
“if I cannot get to windward of those fellows this
time.”</p>

<p>True enough, the pirate schooner was seen in the light
of the morning opposite the harbour of Port-of-Spain,
but at an immense distance out at sea.</p>

<p>The heavy sails of the large ship then began leisurely
to ascend its encumbered masts, in preparation for the
chase of the pirate vessel.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When Appadocca with his party had gained the
schooner, he immediately ordered the prisoner Willmington
to be taken to the torture-room and to be there kept
in custody: at the same time the men were summoned
to the main deck, and the booty of the previous night,
was distributed in the same manner as we have described
at the beginning of this tale.</p>

<p>In the meantime the morning dawned more brightly,
and the waters of the gulf lay smooth and shining before
the piercing rays of the morning sun, unbroken as
they were by the faintest breath.</p>

<p>The heavy sails of the man-of-war were still seen to
ascend one by one, and fall, as they were spread, heavily
against the masts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>They reflected the sunbeams from their white and clear
surface, far and wide: and amidst the number of vessels
in the harbour, the huge ship-of-war, with all its canvass
spread, and its stern decorated with the fiery ensign of
England, looked like a gigantic monarch of the sea that
floated at the head of its smaller subjects.</p>

<p>She was now ready to weigh anchor, and was
now evidently only waiting for the wind which was
certain to spring about the hour of ten in the forenoon.</p>

<p>When Appadocca had superintended the division of
the spoil amongst his followers, he ordered the young
midshipman to be brought before him.</p>

<p>That individual, in a few moments, made his appearance.
He had scarcely as yet recovered from the effects
of his torture; he was pale, and appeared still weak and
emaciated. Yet in his eye there could now be read a
more earnest seriousness—the fruit of the self dependent
position in which he had for some time so accidentally
found himself, and the consequence of the example to
whose power he had been exposed, in the stern and
manly society into which he had been thrown.</p>

<p>From a boy whose yearnings had been continually
after excitement and pleasure, he was suddenly transformed
into a man, whose thoughts began to be characterised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
by the seriousness of purpose which alone can be
worthy of the highest of the animal creation.</p>

<p>A change was marked on his face, and his demeanour
was more subdued and more self-possessed.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said Appadocca, as he stood before
him, “I set you at liberty, you shall have a small boat,
which will in a moment be ready for you, you will be
able to skull to your ship. I cannot, I am sorry to say,
spare any of my men to help you. I see she is preparing
to weigh anchor. Take my compliments to the
commander himself, and tell him, to take the advice of
one, who has experienced much kindness at his hands, and
by no means to move from his anchorage to-day. Ask
him to consult a calculation which I made on the partition
of the cabin in which I was confined, and he will
know the reason. Before you leave the schooner, ask
the officer of the watch for a letter which I shall send
to your commander’s son.”</p>

<p>Appadocca then descended into his cabin and wrote
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Hamilton</span>,</p>

<p>“The consummation of my existence is now fast
approaching; I, therefore, write to you, as I fear it
will be the last time that I may have the opportunity of
communicating with a dear friend, from whose heart I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
have experienced so much consideration, and from whose
hands I have received so much kindness! It is scarcely
necessary for me to tell you, that destiny preserved me
from the perils from which few could have hoped to
escape.</p>

<p>“I am at the head of my faithful followers once more,
and it rejoices me to think that my escape was effected
entirely by my own efforts and quite unknowingly to one
on whose escutcheon I should not have even virtue itself
accidentally to paint a blot. I shall lead the men who
have followed me so bravely, and who have served me so
faithfully, to some remote spot on the fertile and vast
continent that lies on our right, and build them a city
in which they may live happily, quietly, and far removed
from the world, whose sympathy they cannot hope, and
care not, to possess. For myself....</p>

<p>Receive, my dear Charles, the sincere good wishes of
one who esteems you.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Emmanuel Appadocca.</span>”</p>

<p>“N.B.—Recollect and prevail upon your father not to
set sail to-day. Remember the tempest of which I spoke,
it will come within these twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class="right">“E. A.”</p>

</div>

<p>The young midshipman was withdrawn and in a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
moments he pushed off gladly from the schooner, and
was soon seen gradually leaving it behind.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock came, and with it the steady trade wind.
The placid gulf curled before it—the vessels at anchor
in the harbour, swung to and fro on their long cables, as
they felt its force, and the vessel-of-war sheered off
under her canvass that swelled and looked full and turgid
with the wind. The sprays flew about her broad bows,
and she was bearing straight down on the schooner with
the wind on her quarter. Every sail that could be
hoisted was set, and her commander seemed again determined
to make another powerful effort, in order to
have a chance of bringing his batteries to bear against
the Black Schooner. As for that vessel herself, she remained
in the same place where she was, and seemed
quite indifferent to the movements of the man-of-war.</p>

<p>Appadocca pensively paced her deck, and looked from
time to time towards the eastern shore.</p>

<p>“The rash and fiery old man,” he muttered, with an
expression half anxious, half indignant, when he saw the
large vessel fall off from her anchorage.</p>

<p>When the wind had become fairly settled in, the order
was given to set sail.</p>

<p>With the usual rapidity, the masts of the schooner
became sheeted in her ample sails, her small kedges were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
let go, and she turned gracefully to the wind. Her bow
pointed to the southern outlet of the gulf—the Serpent’s
Mouth.</p>

<p>The calm and placid picture which the two vessels
presented, as they sailed in the same direction, bore in
itself but a faint resemblance to the fierce passions that
might animate their crews, or the bloody deeds which
might be done if once they came within gun-shot of each
other.</p>

<p>The usually quiet gulf smiled under the freshness of
the morning: the two vessels sailed smoothly on its
even bosom. There was no labouring, no plunging, no
heaving of terrible seas, to call forth any feeling, akin to
terror.</p>

<p>The dark blue waves appeared through the thin
vapours of the morning like a landscape in a picture, and
the light slender fishing canoes, with their feather-like
sails, which seemed to play on the waters, like butterflies in
the beams of a sunny day, added a peculiar and peaceful
appearance to the scene.</p>

<p>The high and solitary mountain of Naparima, with a
few scattered and scathed trees on its crown, rose in the
distance; while the low sloping shores before, seemed
entirely to enclose the gulf, and to hem it round against
the violence of intrusive winds. Upon the whole, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
beholder, on seeing the two vessels together, with the
thousand sailing boats and sloops that followed in the
wake of the man-of-war in order to witness the exciting
scene of an action, might have taken them to be the
pleasure ships of luxurious lordlings, who had launched
forth on the deep to seek another subject of excitement,
in order to cheat monotony of some of its victim-days.</p>

<p>The pirate schooner held its course with an indifference
that would not have led one to believe she was
pursued. The watchful chief stood by the shroud of
the mainmast, with his arms folded on his breast, calm
and impassable as he was at almost all the moments of
his life.</p>

<p>Not so the pursuing man-of-war. Ever and anon, as
any of the small sailing vessels that navigate the gulf
came in sight, signals upon signals went up her masts, to
intimate that the vessel ahead was a pirate, and to command
it to be harassed and hindered in its course. But
all these were lost on the simple skippers of those simple
crafts.</p>

<p>The chase continued. The terrible rock that is
known by the name of the “soldier,” and that true to
its appellation, seems to guard with unsurprizeable vigilance
the passage of the Serpent’s Mouth, was passed.
Point Icacos, too, was doubled, and the two vessels were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
now riding on the atlantic billows, with the low Orinoco
marshes on the right, and the rocky and wild coast of
Trinidad on the left.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, when, suddenly, as if some
monster screen had been abruptly raised from earth to
heaven, in order to keep one part of the globe from the
other, the wind fell, and the sails lay like humid
sheets against the masts.</p>

<p>“Nature will now begin to speak,” said Appadocca
to himself, with a certain air of contentment now lighting
up his stern brow, and then looked aloft and
around.</p>

<p>At his order, the spars were instantaneously armed
with steel spears, from whose feet, conducting wires
hung down along the shrouds and dipped into the sea.
At another order, the large jibs, foresail, and mainsail
of the schooner were stripped from the masts, and in
their place, small narrow sails, which, from their size,
could not have been supposed to be capable of having
the least effect, were set.</p>

<p>The guns were doubly secured in their places, and
the arms were fastened with even greater care than
usual in their cases, in the bulwarks.</p>

<p>The two vessels now lay on the ocean, that now
heaved as if from its own convulsions; for the lightest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
vane hung straight and stiffly down. There was not a
breath of air. The vessels turned round and round
helplessly on the seas, and as they rose on this wave,
and were beaten athwart, or astern by the other, for the
billows rolled at this time in no regular course, they fell
into the troughs, or rose on the brows of the waves
with such sudden and straining movements, that the
wood and iron that formed them, seemed scarcely strong
enough to hold together.</p>

<p>Night closed in; with it came a darkness that in itself
was awful. No man could see his hand before him,
shipmate could not see even the shipmate that stood at
his side; which was the sea, which the deck, no one
could tell, save when some counter-running wave broke
suddenly on the side or bow of the schooner, and threw
up the myriads of shining insects that inhabited its
full and swollen bosom.</p>

<p>Those that were obliged to move about, clung cautiously
to the bulwarks, and set one foot carefully
before the other, that they might not throw themselves
over.</p>

<p>The cries of the terror-stricken sea-birds, as they
wandered on the still and suffocating air, with even instinct
failing to lead them to their resting place on the
shore, sounded hoarse and ominous to the ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>Not a sound was heard on board the schooner, except
the creaks of the straining cordage, as the vessel violently
and madly plunged.</p>

<p>Now, like molten lead, the rain began to fall in large,
heavy, and leisurely drops. Then distant sounds, like
the groans of a labouring world, when earthquakes shake
it to its base, were heard. A sudden and faint gush of
wind, like the fluttering of gigantic wings, came and
turned the schooner round and round, and passed away,
leaving the deadly calm as it was before. Flash—flash—the
lightning came, and by its lurid light, the ocean
to the southward shone in one sheet of foam.</p>

<p>“How is your helm?” inquired Appadocca of the
steersman.</p>

<p>“Very slack, your excellency. She does not feel it,”
the man replied.</p>

<p>The sounds increased; they approached nearer and
nearer; they came, and like a toy in the hand of a
giant, the schooner was suddenly thrown on her beam-ends.
The water washed one-half of her long deck,
and the first gust of the hurricane swept with a terrible
noise, over the prostrate vessel, and seemed to crush
her, like a mountain that had fallen from its base, and
had met some paltry obstacle in its way, while it was
rolling along to find its level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Luff,” cried the chief to the steersman.</p>

<p>“Luff.”</p>

<p>The schooner lay on her side for a few minutes, as if
she would never right again: at last, like an impatient
steed, whose course has been arrested by some temporary
barrier, after sustaining the violence of the gust, she
sprang forth into the face of the wind, and seemed like
a thing of passion and pride, roused to brave the power
of the overwhelming hurricane.</p>

<p>With the scanty storm sails, which the foresight of
Appadocca had had bent, she shot through the mountain
billows with her usual speed, cleaving them through,
and throwing the sprays mast high.</p>

<p>On—on, she went, as if actuated by the bold spirit of
the man who commanded her, she sought to penetrate
the very bosom of the hurricane.</p>

<p>Her slender masts bent like willows to and fro, as she
mounted the mountains of rushing water, that struck
and shook her to the very keel.</p>

<p>By the flashes of glaring and frequent lightning, the
fierce sailors could now and then be seen standing
stolidly at their respective stations, their red caps drawn
far down over their puckered brows, and their black
beards dripping with spray and rain.</p>

<p>A rope fastened each man to his post, and unmoved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
like carved wood, they stood in the terrors of the
howling winds: the bonds of discipline were still on
them.</p>

<p>As for Appadocca himself far from evincing any
anxiety, he seemed to take pleasure in the terrible convulsions
of nature. With the dark heavens above him
re-echoing far and wide with the rolls of the loud and
never-ceasing thunder; with the balancing ocean below
him, and the terrifying howls of the devastating hurricane
around him, he was the same unimpassioned, collected,
intrepid man, as when the schooner rode on the
calmest sea, under the most smiling sky. He seemed
to take pleasure—if his nature could receive pleasure—in
the awe-striking scene. Ever and anon he took up
his red cap, and pressed his hand over his brow in
apparent delight.</p>

<p>The schooner still laboured in the seas that now began
to grow higher and higher, and heavier and heavier.
The lightnings came and played about her masts, like
the spirits of the tempest, that seemed marking her as
their victim; but the fluid glided down the wires, and
lost itself in the foaming deep.</p>

<p>Still on—on—on she went. A terrible gust....
She was laid on her beams again. The wind was gone:
the air was calm and close: not a breath;—her narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
sails hung to her masts, and she was tossed about
without wind enough to feel her helm.</p>

<p>At this frightful interval the echoes of rending broadsides
were heard towards the north. They were the
reports of the man-of-war’s distress guns.</p>

<p>“Take in the fore and mainsail,” cried Appadocca,
in a voice that seemed to sound solitary and lonely
amidst the terrors of the night.</p>

<p>“Reef the jib.”</p>

<p>The order was scarcely executed, when the rumbling
sounds were again heard. It was coming—it was coming;
the schooner was thrust forward, as if some
immense rock had been let to fall against her; her bows
were dashed through the approaching billows; as she
emerged for a moment, the same power thrust her backwards;
her stern sank under the volumes of water that
washed over her decks; and then, as quick as thought,
she was lifted from the surface, and twisted, and
twisted, and turned reelingly round in mid-air, and was
let to fall with a tremendous crash again. Crack—crack—her
two tapering masts snapt from the deck.
They were overboard, and the lately resisting schooner
was now borne with the rapidity of lightning before
the hurricane.</p>

<p>“Get up the anchors,” the voice of Appadocca was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
again heard; as he recovered from the concussion of the
whirlwind.</p>

<p>The prostrate sailors scrambled from the corners into
which they had been thrown; the hatches were raised,
and the only hope of the schooner,—the anchors—were
quickly drawn on deck.</p>

<p>The hurricane was now at its height. Like a feather
on the overturning currents of an overflowing cataract,
the vessel was furiously borne away before the sweeping
wind.</p>

<p>The anchors, with their immense coils of chain-cable
were thrown overboard, to arrest the progress of the
vessel for a time, until jury-masts could be rigged.</p>

<p>It was of no avail.—Fast—fast—before the wind the
schooner went; and then a grating noise, and a dreadful
shock;—every man fell on his face—she was ashore—on
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Save yourselves, my brave men,” the deep-toned
Appadocca cried, as he stood boldly prominent amidst
the surrounding rack and ruin.</p>

<p>The ocean was fringed with foam, as it broke on the
rocks of Trinidad, on which the once beautiful schooner
was at this moment being dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>The sailors now thought of saving themselves. The
distance from dry land was not much, and it might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
gained on the crest of the waves, if no rock dashed to
pieces the daring fugitives in their attempt.</p>

<p>Each bold pirate watched his time, and leapt boldly on
the crest of the billow, as it came washing by, and in
the twinkling of an eye, was thrown up high and dry,
alive or dead, on the top of the rocks.</p>

<p>Already every man had left the schooner, and had
perished or been tossed up alive.</p>

<p>Appadocca still stood leaning on the bulwarks, contemplating
the sad remnants of his once all but animated
vessel.</p>

<p>Lorenzo and Jack Jimmy drew together imperceptibly
to his sides. They stood around him silent, and
unperceived.</p>

<p>The schooner was breaking up; still Appadocca stood
where he was.</p>

<p>“Will not your excellency go on shore?” Lorenzo at
last ventured to say.</p>

<p>Appadocca started slightly, as if awakened from a
dream or reverie.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lorenzo; but save yourselves first. Watch
the wave; here it is—jump in—you, too, Jack Jimmy,
quickly, so, so.”</p>

<p>The two men jumped on the billow as it swept by the
schooner, Appadocca followed, and they reached the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>Now the wind suddenly ceased as before.</p>

<p>Appadocca, with Lorenzo and Jack Jimmy, were
sitting on the top of a lofty rock: they were viewing
the last struggles of their vessel.</p>

<p>“A terrible night, this is, Lorenzo,” said Appadocca.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, your excellency, a frightful night! for——hark!
What cry is that? It is from the schooner,”
cried Lorenzo, as he stood up.</p>

<p>A supernatural shriek fell on the ear. It came from
the schooner. Again it came—again—and again—as
she was battered against the rock.</p>

<p>The three persons were silent.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” cried Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“It is the prisoner—I may save him yet—I may
save him yet,” said Lorenzo.</p>

<p>They were the shrieks of James Willmington, who
was still battened down in the narrow torture-room, into
which he had been thrown, and was undergoing more
than a thousand deaths; dying as he was, thus cooped
up in a dark narrow cabin, and the vessel breaking
asunder under him.</p>

<p>The cabin was so close, that his terrified shrieks could
not be heard before; but now, when the seams were
opened, they alone, prolonged, and agonizing as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
were, were now to be heard in the lull of the wind, on
the silent, close, and death-strewn air.</p>

<p>Lorenzo rushed down the rock, but ere he could devise
a means to rescue him, the schooner broke in two,
and the unhappy Willmington sank for ever, still a
prisoner in the torture-room.</p>

<p>The schooner went to pieces, and soon the billows
rolled on the rocks over her once graceful form.</p>

<p>Appadocca silently watched the gradual destruction
of his vessel, and silently listened to the shrieks of his
father.</p>

<p>When not a timber of her remained above water,
he heaved a heavy sigh. The first, that Lorenzo had
ever heard from him. It was the sigh that came from a
hurricane of feelings within him, which equalled the
raging hurricane of nature without.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said Appadocca to his officer who had
returned to the wreck, “that was a good and faithful
vessel.”</p>

<p>“Ay, your excellency,” replied Lorenzo, sorrowfully,
“she was.”</p>

<p>“All things must end, Lorenzo,” continued Appadocca.</p>

<p>“True, your excellency,” answered Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“If so, Lorenzo, the honours and greatness of men
are scarcely to be longed after. The pursuits that engross
us during an entire lifetime, and lead us too
frequently, to sacrifice health, happiness, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
even drag us into crime, must all—all end in this—in
nothing.”</p>

<p>“True, your excellency,” answered Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“You know not, Lorenzo, how different the world
appears to me now, from what it did when I was a happy
student of eighteen. It was then tinged with golden
hues, and shone in whatever light I viewed it. Greatness:
oh, greatness, seemed so captivating to me! My
nights were devoted to its attainment, my days the same.
Now, the world is charmless, scarcely tolerable, and my
beautiful dreams have all passed away like the crystal
dew before the sucking sun.”</p>

<p>“There is still hope, your excellency,” remarked
Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“What among all things seems the most deserving of
preservation, Lorenzo,” continued Appadocca, “is our
honour, our consciousness of acting right. How many
a mind that is curbed down by misfortune and sorrow,
finds its own little relief in the simple idea, that it has
acted up to the dictates of its honor.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo made no reply, he saw that his chief was
deeply affected.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” resumed Appadocca, after a pause, “there
is destiny—there is destiny—there is a synchronism of
events and a simultaneousness of the actings of nature’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
general laws that constitute destiny; against which no
men from the absence of any power to read the future
can provide. Thus, in the whirlwind, that raises in
mid-air the light feather, there is to be seen the hand of
destiny, for there is the synchronism of the feather’s
being separated from the bird with the acting of the law
of nature that produces the wind. It would have been as
impossible to the bird, granting that its reasoning powers
were less limited, to have provided against the falling of
its feather and the eventual taking of it up by storm, as
it was impossible to foresee the whirlwind that overcame
the schooner which was made to pass through every
danger.”</p>

<p>“Too true, your excellency,” answered Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“So that it follows,” continued Appadocca, “that
since men are subject to the former of this destiny, their
most strenuous efforts must always prove impotent in
restraining its action, and that they are liable every
moment, whether they are good, or whether they are
bad, to be subjected to misfortune and calamity. And
this corroborates what I have already said, that the only
thing which we are bound to consider in life, is our honor,
which alone is, or ought to be, the source of satisfaction
or misery to us.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo assented to the philosophy of Appadocca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“If ever I should be suddenly overtaken by the hand
of this destiny recollect, beneath the solitary fig-tree
that grows on the Island of Sombrero, you will find a
treasure. Devote half to the erection of a college for
abandoned children, and with the rest provide for my
men who have served me truly. Do not forget that
peculiar old servant,” he said in a low tone, and pointed
to Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Your excellency is growing melancholy,” observed
Lorenzo, with some anxiety.</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Appadocca. “Still, who knows
how soon destiny may end his days.”</p>

<p>“For you, Lorenzo, you have acted towards me in a
manner that I have duly appreciated,” continued Appadocca,
while he grasped his officer’s hand, “here is my
sword, wear it, and may the time soon arrive when you
may use it in the cause to which you are pledged, farewell!”</p>

<p>With a spring Appadocca jumped from the rock and
threw himself headlong into the thundering waves
below.</p>

<p>His movement was so sudden that Lorenzo, and Jack
Jimmy, who sprang to their feet at once, were too late
to hold him back and save him.</p>

<p>The little negro silently returned to the spot where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
had sat since he had come on shore, and hid his face in
his hands. Not a word—not a sob escaped him. His
grief was too deep and strong for tears.</p>

<p>Morning dawned on the devastated scene of the late
hurricane.</p>

<p>Like a strong man who is recovering from illness,
nature presented a smiling, though languid look. The
billows still ran high, but unlashed now by the wind, they
rolled heavily against the rocks.</p>

<p>High and dry lay the bodies of the dead, their pallid
faces still locked in the grim passions which had attended
the departure of life.</p>

<p>The dawn had scarcely come, when Jack Jimmy might
have been seen moving totteringly along the ruffled
beach, with a dead body on his shoulders. Away into a
solitary recess of the picturesque little bay, he bore his
burden. He lay it down, and then slowly began to scoop
a hole.</p>

<p>Solemnly he worked—his arms rose and fell like his
heart—heavily.</p>

<p>But who comes to interrupt the sacred work!
Lorenzo! It was Lorenzo. He had followed Jack
Jimmy to the spot. The officer began to dig, too.</p>

<p>“Tap, massa—tap,” said Jack Jimmy, solemnly
grasping his arm—“let me one do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>The hole was dug:—Jack Jimmy adjusted the uniform
and hair of the corpse, composed its features, and
laid it carefully in it.</p>

<p>His arms again rose and fell as heavily as before:—the
grave was closed, and made even with the ground.
Jack Jimmy knelt at its foot, raised his eyes to heaven—his
lips rapidly moved, and a heavy tear fell on the
simple grave of the pirate captain.</p>

<p>It was about this time that a little <i>fallucha</i> came
labouring over the still perturbed waves under four
powerful sweeps. At its stern sat the captain and a lady.</p>

<p>Attracted by the signs of the shipwrecked pirates, she
drew towards the shore.</p>

<p>The tale of the wreck was soon told. The lady raised
her hands and held her forehead as if it were about to
split asunder. She landed, and walked along the strand
and studied each dead man’s face that she passed by.
She arrived at the spot where Jack Jimmy was completing
the grave, and was adjusting each tiny pebble
in its proper place.</p>

<p>Her heart sank within her. Quickly she approached
the one who was toiling in so sad a mood.</p>

<p>“Whose grave is this?” the lady quickly asked.</p>

<p>“My young massa’s,” Jack Jimmy slowly answered,
without raising his eye from his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“What was his name?” again asked the lady.</p>

<p>“Emmanuel Appadocca,” again answered Jack Jimmy,
as slowly as before.</p>

<p>“Emmanuel Appadocca!”</p>

<p>The lady raised her hands to her burning brows, and
pressed her eyes. She remained for a few moments in
this position. Then her arms fell languidly by her sides,
an expression of vagueness spread itself over her face,
she looked absently around, a ringing laugh broke forth
from her lips, her jaws then hung mopingly. Feliciana
fell mad over Appadocca’s grave.</p>

</div>

<p>Feliciana was taken to her <i>fallucha</i>, which immediately
changed her course, and returned to Trinidad.</p>

<p>Lorenzo built a camp on the shore for the protection
of his men, until he should be able to send a vessel to
their rescue, and then began to traverse the island under
the guidance of Jack Jimmy, whose excitability had
now yielded to a melancholy and dull sombreness.</p>

<p>One evening the sun had set, the twilight was passing
away, and gloom was settling over the forests, when
Lorenzo, exhausted and fatigued, thought of going to
ask shelter on a plantation, which he knew to be near at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
hand, by the repeated crowings of cocks, that noisely
vented their loud farewell-clarions to the departing
day.</p>

<p>“Jack Jimmy, do you know who is the proprietor of
the estate which I think we are approaching?”</p>

<p>“No, massa,” answered Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Do you think they would give us shelter for to-night?”
inquired Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“Yes, massa,” answered Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Then will you endeavour to find your way to it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa.”</p>

<p>In about half an hour, Lorenzo and Jack Jimmy
came out amidst a number of flourishing gardens, that
lay smiling at the back of a village of labourer’s
houses.</p>

<p>The two travellers quickly crossed there, and opened
into a long lane that was shaded by tall tamarind and
sappodilla trees.</p>

<p>An ecclesiastic was seen calmly pacing this umbrageous
retreat, while his lips rapidly moved as he pored
over the dark and riband-marked breviary, which he
held open before.</p>

<p>The father was so wrapped up in what he was reading,
that he did not perceive the two strangers until they
had almost met face to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>The priest started back, as he came on Lorenzo.
“Mercy on us! the pirate officer!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What, what new deed is it, sir;” he said, after a
pause: “which now tarnishes your soul again, and
draws you to this peaceful and quiet retreat?”</p>

<p>“Pirate officer no longer, good father,” answered
Lorenzo, “and I bring no outrage on your peaceful
retreat. My spirit now itself requires too much calm
to break it wherever it already exists.”</p>

<p>The priest folded his arms across his breast, and
looked silently and sympathisingly on the unhappy man
before him.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said, with a countenance that beamed
with charity; “my son, there is one above that
can relieve our bitterest woes. Seek consolation in
the afflictions which, press upon your soul from His
hand.”</p>

<p>“I am now in your power, good father,” said Lorenzo.
“The schooner is wrecked on these shores; Appadocca is
no more.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” cried the priest.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The priest turned towards heaven, and prayed for the
soul of the pirate captain.</p>

<p>“God forbid that I should ever refuse charity to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
afflicted: come with me, sir, and my good patron will,
I doubt not, afford you hospitality.”</p>

<p>The three persons walked up the lane, and discovered
a comfortable planter’s house, that stood in an open
space amidst a number of orange trees. They quickly
approached the house; and Agnes, who was sitting at
the open window enjoying the evening breeze, fell senseless
to the ground, as she beheld Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="tb">“Accommodate the stranger as soon as possible,”
said a fiery looking old man, whose gray hair floated
over his shoulders, and fell over a large and turned-down
collar, while the boots which had not crossed the
threshold for many a day, still shone with heavy and
immense silver spurs.</p>

<p>“Accommodate the stranger, and get him a guide
as soon as possible,” he said, as soon as the priest
told him of Agnes’s illness, and had no doubt expressed
his own surmises.</p>

<p class="tb">The time for Lorenzo’s departure approached. He
was informed that a guide and a mule awaited his
leisure.</p>

<p>“I must see the master of the house,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>The servant withdrew, and shortly afterwards conducted
the officer into the presence of the old man,
who stood up as well as he could, bowed, and asked
Lorenzo to be seated.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Lorenzo, speaking without any preliminaries;
“your daughter and I love each other.”</p>

<p>“What, sir! mention my daughter!” cried the old
man, furiously, without hearing any more. “Sir, the
mule and guide are ready.”</p>

<p>But there was a softening balm even for the inflammable
spirit of the old gentleman. He, like all other
men, had the particular point by which he could be
lead!</p>

<p>The pirate officer immediately disclosed that his real
name was not Lorenzo, but St. James Carmonte; and
that he was the lineal descendant of the Carmontes,
who fell fighting for the Prince. He went on to explain
that his people before him had vegetated in a number of
corners all over Europe; but that he and the others
that then survived had been eventually expelled from
France at the epoch of the great revolution. That he
had then taken to the sea, there to seek adventures; as
he imagined he had been long-enough on the enduring
side.</p>

<p>“What! the descendant of Carmonte,” cried the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
man, who was touched in a sensitive part: “Carmonte,
whose fathers fought at the side of mine. How can
you vouch this, sir?”</p>

<p>Lorenzo presented a ring.</p>

<p>“The word, sir.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo said something.</p>

<p>“Agnes, Agnes, come hither, Agnes,” vociferated
the old man.</p>

<p>The young lady appeared. She was still pale and
emaciated.</p>

<p>“Take her, take her, man,” cried the old cavalier.
“May God bless you, and preserve you to see the
day when the king shall enjoy his own again.”</p>

<p>The priest blessed the union, and Lorenzo, after
disposing of Appadocca’s followers, lived happy in the
retreat of the plantation.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy served the officer of his young master
with fidelity. A smile, however, was never seen more
on his face; and when the winds howled more loudly
than usual, the drops calmly fell from his now aged
eyes.</p>

<p>In a certain city of Venezuela, Feliciana might be
seen in her white veil, and her sombre dress, amidst the
abodes of the heart-stricken and afflicted; she was
known as the “Succouring Mother.” Twice a-year she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
might also be seen on her pilgrimage to Trinidad, when
she plucked the weeds from off his mother’s tomb, and
tended the sea-grape tree that grew over the lonely
grave of <span class="smcap">Emmanuel Appadocca</span>.</p>
